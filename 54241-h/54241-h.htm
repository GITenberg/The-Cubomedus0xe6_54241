<p>This Treatise is printed after the author’s death, as a Memorial by
his friends, fellow-students and instructors, with the aid of the Johns
Hopkins University. It consists of his Dissertation, reprinted from the
copy which was accepted by this University at his examination for the
degree of Doctor of Philosophy in June, 1897.</p>

<p>As he had made many notes on the embryology of the Cubomedusæ,
and had hoped to complete and publish them together with an account
of physiological experiments with these medusæ, he had described the
Dissertation on the title-page as Part I, Systematic and Anatomical, and
he went to Jamaica immediately after his examination to continue his
studies and to procure new material, and he there lost his life.</p>

<p>Franklin Story Conant was born in Boston on September 21, 1870,
and he died in Boston on September 13, 1897, a few days after his arrival
from Jamaica, where he had contracted yellow fever through
self-sacrificing devotion to others.</p>

<p>He was educated in the public schools of New England; at the
University of South Carolina; at Williams College, where he received
the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1893; and in the Johns Hopkins
University, where he received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 1897,
and where he was appointed a Fellow in 1896 and Adam T. Bruce Fellow
in 1897.</p>

<p>Most of his instructors have told us that they quickly discovered that
Conant was a young man of unusual intelligence and energy and uprightness,
and as his education progressed he secured the esteem and the
affectionate interest of all who had him in charge, so that they continued
to watch his career with increasing pride and satisfaction.</p>

<p>He entered the Johns Hopkins University in the spring of 1894, and
at once joined the party of students in zoology who were working, under
my direction, in the marine laboratory of the University at Beaufort,
North Carolina; and from that time until his death he devoted himself
continually, without interruption, to his chosen subject&mdash;spending his
winters in the laboratory in Baltimore, and devoting his summers to out-of-door
studies at Beaufort and at Wood’s Holl, and in Jamaica.</p>

<p>It is as a student and not as an investigator that we most remember
Conant, for most of his time was given to reading and study on subjects
of general educational value; although he had begun, before his death,
to make original contributions to science and to demonstrate his ability
to think and work on independent lines.</p>

<p>His study of the Chaetognaths was undertaken only for the purpose
of verifying the account of their anatomy and development in the text
books, but it soon showed the presence at Beaufort of several undescribed
species. Without interrupting his more general studies, he employed
his odd moments for three years in their systematic analysis, and at
last published two papers, “Description of Two New Chaetognaths,” and
“Notes on the Chaetognaths,” which show notable power of close and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
accurate observation and of exact description; and, while short, are
valuable contributions to our knowledge of this widely distributed but
difficult group.</p>

<p>As he appreciated the value to one who has devoted himself to zoology
of thorough acquaintance with physiological problems and the means for
solving them, he wished, after he had completed his general course in
physiology, to attempt original research in this field; and, at the suggestion
of Professor Howell, he, in company with H. L. Clark, his fellow
student, undertook and successfully completed an investigation of which
Professor Howell gives the following account:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In connection with Mr. H. L. Clark, Mr. Conant undertook to investigate the
character of the nervous control of the heart beat in decapod crustaceans. They
selected the common edible crab, Callinectes hastatus, and made a series of most
careful experiments and dissections which resulted in proving the existence of one
inhibitory nerve and two accelerator nerves passing to the heart on each side from
the thoracic ganglion. They not only demonstrated the physiological reaction of
these nerves, but traced out successfully their anatomical course from the ganglion to
the pericardial plexus. It seemed hardly probable from an a priori standpoint that in
an animal like the crab there should be any necessity for an elaborate nervous mechanism
to regulate the beat of the heart, but their experiments placed the matter
beyond any doubt, and have since served to call attention to this animal as a promising
organism for the study of some of the fundamental problems in the physiology of
the heart. As compared with previous work upon the same subject it may be said
that their experiments are the most definite and successful that have yet been made.</p>

</div>

<p>His chief completed work, the Dissertation on The Cubomedusæ, is
here printed; and through it the reader who did not know Conant must
decide whether he was well fitted, by training and by natural endowments,
for advancing knowledge. I myself felt confident that the career
on which he had entered would be full of usefulness and honor. I was
delighted when he was appointed to the Adam T. Bruce Fellowship, for
I had discovered that he was rapidly becoming an inspiring influence
among his fellow students in the laboratory, and I had hoped that we
might have him among us for many years, and that we might enjoy and
profit by the riper fruits of his more mature labors.</p>

<p>Immediately after his examination for the degree of Doctor of
Philosophy in June, 1897, he set out for Jamaica to continue his
studies at the laboratory which this University had established for the
summer at Port Antonio, and he there worked for nearly three months
on the development, and on the physiology of the sense-organs, of the
Cubomedusæ.</p>

<p>His notes and specimens are so complete that I hope it will be
possible to complete in Baltimore, at an early day, the work which he
had expected to carry on this year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<p>After the sudden and alarming death of the director of the expedition,
Dr. J. E. Humphrey, Conant took the burden of responsibility upon
himself, and while he fully appreciated his own great danger, he devoted
himself calmly and methodically to the service of others who, in their
afflictions, needed his help, and he fell in the path of duty, where he had
always walked, leaving behind him a clear and simple account of all the
business of the laboratory and of his scientific work, and of his own
affairs, complete to the day before his death.</p>

<p>Immediately after the opening of the University in October his
friends and companions and instructors assembled to express the sorrow
with which they had heard the sad news of his death, and to record their
love and esteem for the generous, warm-hearted friend who in all the
relations of life had proved himself so worthy of their affectionate
remembrance. At this meeting those who had worked at his side in our
laboratories recalled his steadfast earnestness in the pursuit of knowledge,
and the encouragement they had found in his bright example;
while those who had been his instructors spoke of him as one who had
bettered their instruction and enriched all that he undertook by sound
and valuable observations and reflections. While all united in mourning
the untimely loss of one who had shown such rich promise of a life full
of usefulness and honor and distinction, it was pointed out with pride
that his end was worthy of one who had devoted it to the fearless pursuit
of truth, and to generous self-sacrifice and noble devotion to others; and
it was resolved, “That we prize the lesson of the noble life and death of
Franklin Story Conant.”</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>Jelly-fish offer to the lover of natural history an inexhaustible store
of beauty and attractiveness. One who has studied them finds within
him a ready echo to Haeckel’s statement that when first he visited the
seacoast and was introduced to the enchanted world of marine life, none
of the forms that he then saw alive for the first time exercised so powerful
an attraction upon him as the Medusæ. The writer counts it a rare
stroke of fortune that he was led to the study of a portion of the group
by the discovery of two new species of Cubomedusæ in Kingston Harbor,
Jamaica, W. I., while he was with the Johns Hopkins Marine Laboratory
in June of 1896.</p>

<p>The Cubomedusæ are of more than passing interest among jelly-fish,
both because of their comparative rarity and because of the high degree
of development attained by their nervous system. One fact alone suffices
to attract at once the attention of the student of comparative morphology&mdash;that
here among the lowly-organized Cœlenterates we find an animal
with eyes composed of a cellular lens contained in a pigmented retinal
cup, in its essentials analogous to the vertebrate structure. Perhaps this
and other facts about the Cubomedusæ would be more generally known,
had they not been to a certain extent hidden away in Claus’s paper on
Charybdea marsupialis (’78), which, while a record of careful and accurate
work, is in many respects written and illustrated so obscurely that
it is very doubtful whether one could arrive at a clear understanding of
its meaning who was not pretty well acquainted with Charybdea beforehand.</p>

<p>Before Claus’s paper was received at this laboratory, H. V. Wilson
went over essentially the same ground upon a species of Chiropsalmus
taken at Beaufort, N. C. When the article on Charybdea marsupialis
appeared, however, the results were so similar that Wilson did not complete
for publication the careful notes and drawings he had made.</p>

<p>Haeckel’s treatment of the Cubomedusæ in his “System” (’79) in the
Challenger Report (’81) is much more lucid than Claus’s; but the extended
scope of his work and the imperfect preservation of his material prevented
a detailed investigation, and for a more complete and readily intelligible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
account of the structure of the Cubomedusæ a larger number of figures
is desirable.</p>

<p>In the foregoing facts lies whatever excuse is necessary for repeating
in the present paper much that has already seen print in one form or
another.</p>

<h2 id="Part_I"><span class="smcap">Part I: SYSTEMATIC.</span></h2>

<p>It seems advisable first of all to establish the systematic position of
the two newly found species, Charybdea Xaymacana and Tripedalia
cystophora. Haeckel’s classification, as given in his “System der
Medusen,” is an excellent one and will be followed in this case. One
of the new species, however, will not classify under either of Haeckel’s
two families, so that for it a new family has been formed and named the
Tripedalidæ. In showing the systematic position of the two new forms,
an outline of Haeckel’s classification will be given, so far as it concerns
our species, together with the additions that have been made necessary.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Cubomedusæ</span> (Haeckel, 1877).</h3>

<p>Characteristics: Acraspeda with four perradial sensory clubs which
contain an auditory club with endodermal otolith sac and one or several
eyes. Four interradial tentacles or groups of tentacles. Stomach with
four wide perradial rectangular pockets, which are separated by four
long and narrow interradial septa, or cathammal plates. Gonads in four
pairs, leaf-shaped, attached along one edge to the four interradial septa.
They belong to the subumbrella, and are developed from the endoderm
of the stomach pockets, so that they project freely into the spaces of the
pockets.</p>

<h4>Family I: <span class="smcap">Charybdea</span> (Gegenbaur, 1856).</h4>

<p>Cubomedusæ with four simple interradial tentacles; without marginal
lobes in the velarium, but with eight marginal pockets; without
pocket arms in the four stomach pockets.</p>

<h5>Genus: <i>Charybdea.</i></h5>

<p>Charybdeidæ with four simple interradial tentacles with pedalia;
with velarium suspended, with velar canals and four perradial frenula.
Stomach flat and low, without broad suspensoria. Four horizontal
groups of gastric filaments, simple or double, tuft or brush-shaped,
limited to the interradial corners of the stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<h6>Species: <i>Charybdea Xaymacana</i> (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 1</a>).</h6>

<p>Bell a four-sided pyramid with the corners more rounded than
angular, yet not so rounded as to make the umbrella bell-shaped. The
sides of the pyramid parallel in the lower two-thirds of the bell, in the
upper third curving inward to form the truncation; near the top a slight
horizontal constriction. Stomach flat and shallow. Proboscis with four
oral lobes, hanging down in bell cavity a distance of between one-third
and one-half the height of bell; very sensitive and contractile, so that it
can be inverted into the stomach. The four phacelli epaulette-shaped,
springing from a single stalk. Distance of the sensory clubs from the
bell margin one-seventh or one-eighth the height of bell. Velarium in
breadth about one-seventh the diameter of the bell at its margin. Four
velar canals in each quadrant; each canal forked at the ends, at times
with more than two branches. Pedalia flat, scalpel-shaped, between one-third
and one-half as long as the height of bell. The four tentacles, when
extended, at least eight times longer than the bell. Sexes separate.
Height of bell, 18-23 mm.; breadth, about 15 mm. (individuals with
mature reproductive elements); without pigment. Found at Port Henderson,
Kingston Harbor, Jamaica.</p>

<p>As may be seen from the above, C. Xaymacana differs only a little
from the C. marsupialis of the Mediterranean. Claus mentions in the
latter a more or less well defined asymmetry of the bell, which he
connects with a supposed occasional attachment by the proboscis to algæ.
In C. Xaymacana I never noticed but that the bell was perfectly symmetrical.
C. Xaymacana is about two-thirds the size given by Claus for
his examples of C. marsupialis, which were not then sexually mature.
It has 16 velar canals instead of 24 (32), as given by Haeckel, or 24 as
figured by Claus. Difference in size and in number of velar canals are
essentially the characteristics upon which Haeckel founded his Challenger
species, C. Murrayana.</p>

<h4>Family II: <span class="smcap">Chirodropidæ</span> (Haeckel, 1877).</h4>

<p>Cubomedusæ with four interradial groups of tentacles; with sixteen
marginal pockets in the marginal lobes of the velarium, and with eight
pocket arms, belonging to the exumbrella, in the four stomach pockets.</p>

<p>This family is represented in American waters by a species of
Chiropsalmus, identified by H. V. Wilson as C. quadrumanus, found at
Beaufort, North Carolina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<h4>Family III: <span class="smcap">Tripedalidæ</span> (1897).</h4>

<p>Cubomedusæ with four interradial groups of tentacles, each group
having three tentacles carried by three distinct pedalia; without marginal
lobes in the velarium; with sixteen marginal pockets; without pocket
arms in the stomach pockets.</p>

<h5>Genus: <i>Tripedalia</i>.</h5>

<p>For the present the characteristics of family and genus must necessarily
be for the most part the same. The genus is distinguished by
having twelve tentacles in four interradial groups of three each; velarium
suspended by four perradial frenula; canals in the velarium; stomach
projecting somewhat convexly into the bell cavity, with relatively well-developed
suspensoria; four horizontal groups of gastric filaments, each
group brush-shaped, limited to the interradial corners of the stomach.</p>

<h6>Species: <i>Tripedalia cystophora</i> (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 17</a>).</h6>

<p>Shape of bell almost exactly that of a cube with rounded edges; the
roof but little arched. The horizontal constriction commonly seen near
the top of the bell in the Cubomedusæ not present. Proboscis with four
oral lobes; hanging down in the bell cavity generally more than half the
depth of the cavity and at times even to the bell margin. In the gelatine
of the proboscis an irregular number (15-21) of sensory organs resembling
otocysts, from the presence of which comes the specific name.
Phacelli brush-shaped, composed of from seven to thirteen filaments
springing from a single stalk in each quadrant, or rarely from two separate
stalks in one of the quadrants. Distance of the sensory clubs from
the bell margin about one-fifth or one-fourth of the height of bell.
Breadth of velarium about one-sixth the diameter of bell at margin;
with six velar canals in each quadrant; the canals simple, unforked.
Pedalia flattened, shaped like a slender knife blade, about half as long as
the height of the bell. Tentacles at greatest extension observed two and
a half times the length of pedalia. Sexes separate. Height of bell in
largest specimens (reproductive elements mature) eight or nine mm.
Breadth same as height or even greater. Color a light yellowish brown,
due in large part to eggs or embryos in the stomach pockets. The reproductive
organs especially prominent by reason of their similar color.
Found in Kingston Harbor, Jamaica.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above that Tripedalia possesses two of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
characteristics of the Charybdeidæ and two of the Chirodropidæ. The
family was named from the prominent feature of the arrangement of
the tentacles, in groups of three with separate pedalia. The small size
of T. cystophora is worthy of note in connection with the fact that of the
twenty species of Cubomedusæ given by Haeckel in his “System” only
two are smaller than 20 mm. in height, and those are the two representatives
of Haeckel’s genus Procharagma, the prototype form of the Cubomedusæ,
without pedalia and without velarium. While Tripedalia has
both pedalia and velarium, it may be perhaps that its small size, taken
in connection with characteristics just about midway between the
Charybdeidæ and the Chirodropidæ, indicate that it is not a recently
acquired form of the Cubomedusæ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="Part_II"><span class="smcap">Part II: GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE ANATOMY OF THE
CUBOMEDUSÆ.</span></h2>

<h3>A: <span class="smcap">Charybdea Xaymacana.</span></h3>

<h4>a. <i>Environment and habit of life.</i></h4>

<p>1. The Cubomedusæ are generally believed to be inhabitants of deep
water which come to the surface only occasionally. Both of the Jamaica
species, however, were found at the surface of shallow water near the
shore, and only under these circumstances. Whether these were their
natural conditions, or whether the two forms were driven by some
chance from the deep ocean into the Harbor and there found their
surroundings secondarily congenial, so to speak, can be a matter of
conjecture only. C. Xaymacana was taken regularly a few yards
off-shore from a strip of sandy beach not ten minutes row from the
laboratory at Port Henderson. It was seen only in the morning before
the sea-breeze came in to roughen the water and to turn the region of its
placid feeding-ground into a dangerous lee-shore. Some of the specimens
taken contained in the stomach small fish so disproportionately
large in comparison with the stomach that they lay coiled up, head overlapping
tail. The name Charybdea, then, from the Greek χαρύβδις (a gulf,
rapacious), seems to be no misnomer. It is worth mentioning that the
digestive juices left the nervous system of the fish intact, so that from
the stomach of a Charybdea could be obtained beautiful dissections, or
rather macerations, of the brain, cord, and lateral nerves of a small fish.</p>

<p>In size C. Xaymacana agrees very well with the average of the
genus. The four single tentacles characteristic of the genus are very
contractile, varying from two or three to six or seven inches in length,
and probably if measurements could be taken while the animal was
swimming freely about, the length would be found to be greater still.
Charybdea is a strong and active swimmer, and presents a very beautiful
appearance in its movements through the water, the quick, vigorous
pulsations contrasting sharply with the sluggish contractions seen in
most Scyphomedusæ. With its tentacles streaming gracefully behind,
an actively swimming Charybdea presents a fanciful resemblance to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
comet or meteor. When an attempt is made to capture one, it will often
escape by going down into deeper water&mdash;as indeed do other jelly-fish.
Escape from observation is all the more easy by reason of the entire
absence of pigment excepting for the small amount in the sensory clubs.
The yellowish or brownish color usually stated as common in the Cubomedusæ
is nowhere present in C. Xaymacana.</p>

<h4>b. <i>External Anatomy.</i></h4>

<p>2. <i>Form of Bell.</i> C. Xaymacana shows the typical division of the
external surface into four almost vertical perradial areas (<a href="#plate1">Figs. 1-3</a>, <i>p</i>),
separated by four stoutly arched interradial ribs or bands (<a href="#plate1">Figs. 1-3</a>, <i>i</i>).
These ribs thus play the part of corners to the Cubomedusan pyramid.
They are formed by the thickenings of the jelly of the exumbrella, and
serve to give the necessary strength to the four interradial corners, each
of which bears one of the four tentacles at its base. Each rib is further
divided into two longitudinal strips by a vertical furrow lying exactly in
the interradius (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 2</a>, <i>ifr</i>). The surface of the exumbrella is thus marked
by twelve longitudinal furrows, as seen in the same figure (<a href="#plate1">2</a>). Of these,
four are the interradial furrows just mentioned; the other eight are the
adradial (<i>afr</i>) furrows, which set off the four perradial surfaces of the
pyramid from the four interradial ribs or bands of the corners, each of
which is again subdivided, as mentioned above, by the shallower interradial
furrows. Each interradial furrow ends above the base of the corresponding
pedalium, at about the level of the sensory club; each adradial
furrow diverges toward the perradius in the lower third of its course,
and thus with its companion furrow narrows down the perradial surface
of the pyramid in the lower part of the bell to an area of not much
greater width than the niches in which the sensory clubs lie. The projecting
interradial corners are of course correspondingly enlarged in the
lower part of the bell, and in this way the contours of the surface are
changed from those figured in the view of the bell from above (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 2</a>)
to those of <a href="#plate1">Fig. 3</a>, which represents a view of the bell margin from below.</p>

<p>3. <i>Pedalia.</i> From the base of the interradial corner bands spring
the four pedalia (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 1</a>, <i>pe</i>), gelatinous appendages of the margin having
much the same shape as the blade of a scalpel. These in turn bear on
their distal ends, as direct continuations, the long, contractile, simple
tentacles. The relatively stiff pedalia have the same relation to the
flexible tentacles that a driver’s whip-stock has to the long lash. In the
living animal the pedalia are found attached to the margin at an angle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of about 45° with the longitudinal axis of the bell. In the preserved
specimens they are bent in toward the axis by the contraction of the
strong muscles at their base, in which position they are figured by Claus
for C. marsupialis (’78, Taf. I., Figs. 1 and 2).</p>

<p>The pedalia are in reality processes belonging to the <i>subumbrella</i>, as
will be shown in the section treating of the vascular lamella. They are
composed chiefly of gelatine covered with thin surface epithelium and
carrying within the gelatine the basal portion of the tentacle canals.
They have received various names at the hands of the writers. Gegenbaur
called them “Randblätter.” Claus gave them the name of “Schirmlappen,”
and incorrectly homologized them with the marginal lobes of
other Acraspeda. Claus’s error was corrected by Haeckel, who termed
them “Pedalia” or “Gallertsockel,” and homologized them with the
pedalia of the Peromedusæ. Besides furnishing a base of support for the
tentacles they may perhaps also serve as steering apparatus, a function
for which their thin blade-like form would be admirably adapted.</p>

<p>Internal to the base of each pedalium, between it and the velarium,
is found a funnel-shaped depression of the ectodermal surface. This is
shown in <a href="#plate2">Fig. 5</a> (<i>ft</i>) in longitudinal section, and in cross-section in <a href="#plate4">Fig. 16</a>.
In the latter figure the epithelium of the outer wall of the funnel (<i>mt</i>) is
shown much thickened, the result of a stout development of muscle
fibres. These are the muscles that in the preserved specimens cause the
inward contraction of the pedalia referred to above.</p>

<p>4. <i>Sensory Clubs</i> (marginal bodies, rhopalia). In spite of their position
above the bell margin, the four sensory clubs, representing as they
do transformations of the four perradial tentacles, are properly classed
with the pedalia and interradial tentacles as appendages of the margin.
They lie protected in somewhat heart-shaped excavations or niches in
the perradial areas of the exumbrella. Each sensory niche is partially
roofed over by a covering scale, a hood-like projection from the exumbrella.
Below the covering scale the water has free access to the niche
and to the sensory club within it. The sensory club consists of a
hollow stock directly homologous with tentacle and canal, and a terminal,
knob-like swelling, the sensory portion proper. The latter contains
on its inner surface&mdash;the surface turned towards the bell cavity&mdash;two
complicated unpaired eyes with lens, retina, and pigment, lying one
above the other in the median line; and at the sides of these, two pairs
of small, simple, pigmented, bilaterally symmetrical eye spots. At the
end of the club, that is, on its lowermost point, lies a sac that contains a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
concretion and is usually considered auditory. The canal of the stalk is
directly continuous with the gastro-vascular system. In the swollen
knob of the sensory club it forms an ampulla-like terminal expansion.</p>

<p>As was pointed out by Claus, the bottom of the sensory niche&mdash;by
bottom is meant the vertical wall that separates the space of the niche
from the bell cavity&mdash;is formed from the subumbrella only. This
arrangement of parts, apparently impossible for a structure so far
removed from the bell margin as the sensory niche, will be explained
more fully under the special topic of the vascular lamellæ, or cathammal
plates. It is sufficient at this point to refer to <a href="#plate6">Fig. 44</a>, which shows the
shield-shaped area mapped out by a vascular lamella that connects the
endoderm of the stomach pocket with the ectoderm of the bottom of
the niche. By this the exumbrella is completely cut off from any part in
the formation of the bottom of the niche. Cross and vertical sections
through the niche (<a href="#plate4">Figs. 39 and 37</a>) help to a better understanding of
these relations. Since the base of the stalk of the sensory niche lies
within the ring of vascular lamella, the whole organ as well as the
bottom of the niche belongs to the subumbrella, and so in spite of its
position some distance upwards from the bell margin the sensory club is
very properly called a “marginal body” (Randkörper).</p>

<p>The epithelium of the sensory niche consists entirely of the flattened
ectodermal surface layer common to the whole exumbrella. No differentiation
suggestive of nervous function in addition to that of the sensory
clubs can be discovered, although it would be quite natural to expect to
find something of the sort, as intimated by Claus (’78, p. 27).</p>

<p>It is worth while to mention again the fact that the eyes are directed
inwardly toward the cavity of the bell. The larger and lower of the two
median eyes looks into the bell cavity horizontally; the smaller upper
eye is turned upward toward the region of the proboscis. This is in the
normal pendant position of the sensory club. The stalk, however, is very
flexible, and a range of other positions of the sense organs is possible,
although nothing was observed to suggest that such positions were
within the control of the animal. The eyes evidently have as their chief
function to receive impressions of what is going on <em>inside</em> the bell, not
outside. Perhaps the strongly biconvex, almost spherical lenses of the
median eyes also point to a focus on near and small objects.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Bell Cavity and its Structures.</i> In general, the bell cavity
repeats the external form of the bell, being almost cubical. In cross-section
it appears very nearly square with the angles in the interradii as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
seen in the series of drawings that figure sections of the whole jelly-fish
at different levels (<a href="#plate3">Figs. 6-16</a>). Above, the bell cavity is roofed over by
the stomach; below, it is open freely to the water, the opening being
narrowed somewhat by the diaphragm-like velarium (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 3</a>, <i>v</i>); the four
flat perradial sides are bounded by the walls of the four broad stomach
pockets, to be described when we come to the internal anatomy.</p>

<p>(a) <i>The Proboscis.</i> From the stomach there hangs down into the
bell cavity the proboscis or manubrium, which consists of a short funnel-shaped
stalk bearing on its distal end the four mouth lobes or lips. The
latter are somewhat broadly V-shaped processes lying in the perradii
with the convexity directed outwards, and with the concavity on the
inside forming the beginnings of four perradial furrows that are continued
upwards to the stomach. The four furrows are shown in the
stalk of the proboscis in <a href="#plate3">Fig. 11</a>, which represents a section taken a little
above the level of the mouth lobes. The same cross-shaped section of the
stalk shows the four perradial prominences or ridges overlying the
furrows, which are the direct continuations of the four projecting mouth
lobes.</p>

<p>(b) <i>The Suspensoria or Mesogonia.</i> The stomach (leaving out of
consideration the proboscis) hangs down into the bell cavity as a slightly
sagging saucer-shaped roof (<a href="#plate2">Figs. 4 and 5</a>). In the four perradii it is
attached to the lateral walls of the subumbrella by four slenderly developed
mesentery-like structures, the suspensoria or mesogonia. These are
simple ridges of gelatine, covered of course with the epithelium of the
bell cavity, which serve to keep the stomach in position much in the way
that a shelf is supported by brackets (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 4</a>, <i>su</i>). The suspensorium
accordingly has two parts, curved so as to lie at right angles with each
other: a vertical portion lying along the wall of the subumbrella, and a
horizontal which passes over from the vertical on to the basal wall of
the stomach. In <a href="#plate3">Fig. 10</a> the suspensorium in each quadrant is shown
cut across just below the angle between the two parts, so that the two
appear in the section as projections on the wall of the stomach and on
the wall of the subumbrella.</p>

<p>(c) <i>The Interradial Funnels or Funnel Cavities.</i> It will be seen at
once that the four suspensoria serve as partitions to divide the upper
portion of the bell cavity, the part that lies between the stomach and the
lateral walls of the subumbrella, into four compartments. These compartments
extend upwards in the four interradii like inverted funnels,
whence their name. In the series of cross-sections they can be traced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
upwards with constantly diminishing area from the level of the suspensoria,
<a href="#plate3">Fig. 10</a> (<i>if</i>), to <a href="#plate3">Fig. 6</a>, which is taken very near the top of the bell.
Homologous structures exist in all the Scyphomedusæ, and in some of
the Lucernaridæ they are continued up even into the stalk of the
attached jelly-fish.</p>

<p>(d) <i>The Velarium.</i> Charybdea, like most of the Cubomedusæ, possesses
a velum-like structure around the opening of the bell cavity
(<a href="#plate1">Fig. 3</a>, <i>v</i>). The velarium is a thin muscular diaphragm, resembling the
true velum in position and essential structures, but differing from the
velum in its origin, and in the possession of diverticula from the gastro-vascular
system, the velar canals. Of these there are in C. Xaymacana
very regularly sixteen, four in each quadrant. Their outline is seen in
<a href="#plate1">Fig. 3</a> to be forked with small irregular accessory processes. As for its
origin, the velarium of the Cubomedusæ is commonly accounted to have
arisen by fusion of marginal lobes, as in the case of the velarium of the
Discomedusæ. Pending decisive ontological evidence, the slight notches
in the four perradii seen in <a href="#plate1">Fig. 3</a> may perhaps be taken as slight indications
of a primitive unfused condition, but the question will be brought
up again when the vascular lamellæ are discussed.</p>

<p>(e) <i>The Frenula.</i> Just as the stomach is attached to the walls of the
subumbrella in the four perradii by the suspensoria, so in the lower part
of the bell cavity the velarium is attached to the wall of the subumbrella
in the perradii by four structures similar to the suspensoria, the frenula
velarii. The frenula, like the suspensoria, resemble the brackets of a
shelf, with the difference that in the case of the frenula the bracket is
above the shelf, their purpose being evidently to keep the velarium stiff
against the outflow of water produced by the pulsations of the bell.
According to the greater need of strength in this case, we find the frenula
stouter, more buttress-like than the suspensoria. The gelatinous ridge
that gives them the necessary firmness is thickened so as to be triangular
in section, as shown in <a href="#plate4">Fig. 16</a> (<i>frn</i>).</p>

<p>(f) <i>Musculature.</i> As is general in medusæ, the muscular system, so
far as known, is restricted to the subumbrella. It has a very simple
arrangement, consisting of a continuous sheet of circular (<i>i. e.</i> horizontal)
striated fibres, which is interrupted only in the four perradii by the
radially directed muscle fibres of the suspensoria and the frenula. In
each quadrant, between the muscle of the suspensorium above and that
of the frenulum below, in an area just internal to the sensory niche,
there lies a space free from muscle. This interruption of the muscle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
layer is shown in <a href="#plate4">Fig. 39</a>. Under the head of musculature belonging to
the subumbrella must be included also the radial, or longitudinal muscles
at the bases of the pedalia, which were mentioned before (<a href="#plate4">Fig. 16</a>, <i>mt</i>).
The mouth lobes and proboscis also are highly contractile and muscular.</p>

<p>(g) <i>Nerve Ring.</i> It is in the possession of a clearly defined nerve
ring that the Cubomedusæ differ from all other Scyphomedusæ whose
nervous system has been carefully studied. The nerve ring shows very
plainly on the surface of the subumbrella as a well-defined clear streak.
Its course is zig-zag or festoon-like. In the interradii, at the basis of the
tentacles, it lies not far from the bell margin. In the perradii it rises to
the level of the sensory clubs. This very striking arrangement is understood
at once when it is remembered that the sensory clubs represent the
four perradial primary tentacles, and were originally situated on the
margin. When all the rest of the margin grew down and away from
the four sensory clubs, fusing below them to form the present intact
edge of the bell, the four portions of the nerve ring that lay in the
perradii were left at the level of the sensory clubs, and the originally
straight nerve ring was thus bent into a bow in each quadrant. The
finer structure of the nerve will be treated of in the special part to be
devoted to the nervous system.</p>

<h4>c. <i>Internal Anatomy.</i></h4>

<p>6. <i>Stomach.</i> The shape of the stomach is approximately that of a
biconvex lens, as seen in <a href="#plate2">Fig. 4</a>, which represents a Charybdea cut in
halves longitudinally in the perradius. The lumen of the proboscis (the
buccal stomach according to Haeckel’s terminology) communicates
directly by a funnel-shaped enlargement with the stomach proper, or
central stomach of Haeckel. The term basal stomach is carried over by
Haeckel from the Stauromedusæ, where it has considerable significance,
to the Cubomedusæ, and applied to the upper part of the central stomach.
In the stalkless Cubomedusæ, however, it has no significance so far as
actual structure goes, and our knowledge of the development of the
Cubomedusæ is as yet too simple for us to say that the upper part of the
main stomach represents what remains of the basal stomach of an
earlier pedunculated stage.</p>

<p>The epithelium of the roof of the stomach is not specially differentiated
and apparently has little or no part in digestion. The epithelium of
the floor, on the other hand, is composed chiefly of very high and thickly
crowded columnar cells which are usually described as coarsely granular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
but under high powers appear to be filled with vacuoles surrounded by a
network of cell substance. Thickly interspersed among these columnar
cells are goblet cells filled with mucus. The floor is thrown into
numerous wrinkles by ridges in the supporting gelatine resulting in
increase of digestive surface. The four perradial grooves of the proboscis
are continued in the perradii along the floor of the stomach as four fairly
deep furrows, which lead directly to the gastric ostia and stomach
pockets&mdash;structures to be described presently. These furrows are lined
with crowded columnar cells, smaller and denser than the other cells of
the digestive epithelium, containing no granules and but little beside the
relatively large, compact, deeply staining nuclei. The furrows probably
represent special ciliated courses.</p>

<p>7. <i>Phacelli.</i> Lying in the four interradial corners of the stomach are
the four phacelli or tufts of gastral filaments to the number of thirty or
thirty-five in each tuft. The filaments are attached to a single stalk, like
the fringe of an epaulette or the hairs of a coarse brush. The stalk
bearing the filaments is an outgrowth of the lower wall of the stomach
just at the point where it fuses with the upper. The phacelli are therefore
structures of the subumbrella, proof of which will be found under
the special topic of the vascular lamellæ. The stalk, an indication of
which appears in <i>sph</i>. <a href="#plate3">Fig. 6</a> (the section being a little below the axis of
the stalk, which lies horizontally), consists of a firm core of gelatine
covered with the high columnar epithelium of the floor of the stomach.
The filaments themselves are slender processes repeating the structure of
the stalk and having a central axis of gelatine for support covered with
glandular epithelium, which in the case of the filaments bears numerous
nettle cells. These processes are extremely contractile, and in the living
animal show a continuous, slow, squirming movement like a mass of
worms. The section just referred to (<a href="#plate3">Fig. 6</a>) shows diagrammatically
three of these filaments (<i>fph</i>) cut across in each quadrant.</p>

<p>8. <i>Peripheral Part of the Gastro-vascular System.</i> The proboscis and
stomach proper comprise the central part of the gastro-vascular system.
In direct communication with the central is a peripheral part composed
of pouches or pockets lying in the vertical sides of the cube-shaped bell,
just as the central stomach lies in its roof. The peripheral part may be
subdivided for convenience of description into the stomach pockets, the
marginal pockets, and the canals of the tentacles and sensory clubs.</p>

<p>(a) <i>Stomach Pockets.</i> These are four broad, thin pouches lying
between the exumbrella and the subumbrella in the four perradii (<i>e. g.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<a href="#plate3">Fig. 9</a>, <i>sp</i>) and separated from one another in the interradii merely by
four thin vertical strips of vascular lamella (<i>ivl</i>) or fusion between the two
endodermal surfaces of a primitively single undivided peripheral cavity.
The structure is exactly that which we should have if in a Hydromedusa,
for example Liriope (Trachomedusæ), the four radial canals broadened
out and the intervening cathammal plates correspondingly narrowed,
until the relations in size were just reversed, and instead of four narrow
radial canals separated from one another by four broad cathammal
plates, we had four broad radial canals or pouches separated by four
narrow cathammal plates.</p>

<p>The stomach pockets communicate at their top with the central
stomach by means of four moderately large openings, the gastric ostia.
These are seen in a side view of the whole animal as triangular spaces
(<a href="#plate1">Fig. 1</a>, <i>g. o.</i>) near the top of the broad perradial sides. In <a href="#plate3">Figures 7 and
8</a> they are seen in cross-sections, in <a href="#plate2">Fig. 4</a> in vertical section.</p>

<p>The communication between the stomach and each stomach pocket
is guarded by a valve that can cut the one entirely off from the other.
The valve is simply the flexible lower margin of the gastric ostium, a thin
vertical fold of the floor of the stomach, semilunar in shape, just at the
point where it is passing over into the stomach pocket. A longitudinal
section, such as is shown in <a href="#plate2">Fig. 4</a>, gives the best idea of the form and
position of the valve that can be obtained from any simple section.
Internal to the valve is seen a depression of the stomach wall, almost
worthy to be called a pocket. The valve itself lies as a wall across the
end of this depression, obstructing a free course to the stomach pocket.
It will be seen at once that any pressure of fluids in the stomach against
this vertical wall, or valve, would serve only to press it against the inner
surface of the exumbrella, and thus effectually close the entrance into
the stomach pocket. Such a closure would both keep the juices of the
stomach from entering the pockets and the embryos in the pockets from
entering the stomach before the proper time.</p>

<p>The depression of the floor of the stomach just internal to the valve
may possibly be a structure of some morphological significance. In one
series of sections it was found that in two of the quadrants the depression
was deeper than that represented in <a href="#plate2">Fig. 4</a>, and extended perceptibly into
the outer or vertical portion of the suspensorium. <a href="#plate7">Fig. 32</a> is a diagram
giving a vertical reconstruction in the perradius of the cross-sections in
which this deepened depression was noticed. <a href="#plate7">Fig. 31</a> is a drawing (the
outline by camera lucida) of one of the cross-sections, through the lowermost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
point of the depression. The figure gives the wall of the stomach
lined with high columnar epithelium (<i>ens</i>), and the wall of the stomach
pockets, with the suspensorium (<i>su</i>) connecting them. The section is
taken just above the broad angle that lies between the two parts of the
suspensorium, that is, in a plane parallel to the arrow <i>a-b</i> in <a href="#plate7">Fig. 32</a>, but
a little lower down. At the points to which the reference letter <i>x</i> (<a href="#plate7">Fig.
31</a>) refers are seen the first indications of the division into two parts, <i>i. e.</i>
of the apex of the angle. The next section or two lower down show the
relation seen in <a href="#plate3">Fig. 10</a> (<i>su</i>). There can be no doubt in this case that the
depression or pocket lies in the outer vertical limb of the suspensorium.
It is the position that gives it at least the appearance of some morphological
significance. In two genera of Lucernaridæ named and
described by Clark (’78), Halicyathus and Craterolophus, the mesogonia
or suspensoria in all four perradii contain broad pockets. These mesogonial
pockets in the Lucernaridæ have given rise to considerable misunderstanding
owing to the fact that in some forms the reproductive
organs bulge out from the stomach pockets in which they structurally
lie, and come to take up a secondary position in the walls of the mesogonial
pockets. The sections of Charybdea above referred to indicate that
among the Cubomedusæ we may have the same structure reduced to its
lowest terms, and may be a feather’s weight in favor of the view that the
Cubomedusæ are descendants of an attached Lucernaria-like form.</p>

<p>Two more diagrams, <a href="#plate7">Figs. 33 and 34</a>, are added in order to give a
more complete understanding of a gastric ostium and its neighboring
structures, the mesogonial pocket and the valve. <a href="#plate7">Fig. 33</a> is a view of the
gastric ostium and valve from the stomach side, and represents the
appearance that would be given by a thick section through the arrow <i>x-y</i> in
<a href="#plate7">Fig. 32</a>, in a plane at right angles to the paper. The heavy lines outlining
the gastric ostium (<i>enr</i> and <i>enfl</i>) represent the place where the plane of the
section has cut across the epithelium of the roof of the stomach above the
ostium and the epithelium of the floor of the pocket-like depression
internal to the valve. The continuation of the two heavy lines in either
side of the ostium represents the region where the roof and floor of the
stomach meet; <i>i. e.</i>, the edge of the lens-shaped stomach. The semilunar
outline of the valve (<i>vg</i>) is shown by a light line just above the epithelium
of the depression. As is seen by the reference arrow in <a href="#plate7">Fig. 32</a>, the valve
lies a little external to the immediate plane of the section, and hence it is
that its inner surface is seen in <a href="#plate7">Fig. 33</a> and not a section of it. The
vertical part of the suspensorium (<i>su</i>) is seen in section below the epithelium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of the depression. The reference numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 denote the
same points in <a href="#plate7">Figs. 32 and 33</a>. <a href="#plate7">Fig. 32</a> referred to <a href="#plate7">Fig. 33</a> would lie in a
plane at right angles to the paper through the reference arrow <i>x-v</i> of the
latter figure.</p>

<p><a href="#plate7">Fig. 34</a> represents a horizontal section through the gastric ostium at
the level of the arrow <i>a-b</i> in <a href="#plate7">Fig. 32</a>, or arrow <i>c-d</i> in <a href="#plate7">Fig. 33</a>. The reference
numbers 5, 6 and 7, 8 denote similar points in the two figures <a href="#plate7">33 and 34</a>.
<a href="#plate7">Fig. 32</a> as referred to <a href="#plate7">Fig. 34</a> is through the arrow <i>e-f</i>; <a href="#plate7">Fig. 33</a> is through the
arrow <i>c-d</i>. In the series of cross-sections, <a href="#plate3">Fig. 9</a> is taken at a level a little
below that of <a href="#plate7">Fig. 34</a>, and passes through the basal part of the valve (<i>vg</i>).</p>

<p>(b) <i>Marginal Pockets.</i> The part of the peripheral portion of the gastro-vascular
system in each quadrant which is called the stomach pocket
extends downwards as far as the sensory niche. Here by the coming
together of the walls of the exumbrella and subumbrella the space between
them is obliterated (<a href="#plate4">Fig. 15</a>) in the immediate perradius. From the
sensory niche downward to the margin each stomach pocket is thus
divided into two smaller pouches, the marginal pockets (<i>mp</i>). In each
side of the Cubomedusan cube there are, then, in Charybdea two
marginal pockets; or in all eight, a characteristic of the family Charybdeidæ.
The marginal pockets as the name implies extend downwards to
the bell margin, and are continued into the velarium as the velar canals.
Of these (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 3</a>) there are two from each marginal pocket, or sixteen in
all. The constancy in their number is one of the characteristics that
distinguish C. Xaymacana from the very closely related C. marsupialis
of the Mediterranean. (Compare <a href="#plate1">Fig. 3</a> with the similar one by Claus
for C. marsupialis, ’78, Taf. I., Fig. 6.) The forked shape, while to be sure
the common form in C. marsupialis, is an almost invariable characteristic
in C. Xaymacana. It may be mentioned again that the presence of
these canals is one of the chief features that distinguish the velarium
of the Scyphomedusæ from the velum of the Hydromedusæ.</p>

<p>(c) <i>Canals of the Sensory Clubs and Tentacles.</i> The four interradial
definitive tentacles and the four perradial transformed tentacles, the
sensory clubs, are hollow, and their canals communicate directly with
the peripheral part of the gastro-vascular system. The canal of the
sensory club in each quadrant leads directly out from the stomach by a
somewhat funnel-shaped opening formed by the approximation of the
two walls of the stomach pocket. The relation of the canal of the sensory
club to the stomach pocket is seen at a glance in <a href="#plate4">Fig. 37</a>. It is given
by means of cross-sections in <a href="#plate3">Figs. 12-14</a>. <a href="#plate3">Figure 12</a> shows the inner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
walls of the stomach pocket approaching the outer at two points, leaving
between them a concavity freely open to the rest of the stomach pocket
above and at the sides. <a href="#plate3">Fig. 13</a>, a little lower down, shows the two walls
fused together at two points, making the interspaces a definite canal
communicating with the stomach pocket above only. This canal lies
directly over the sensory niche, and in the next figure (<a href="#plate4">No. 14</a>) the canal
is seen to have passed through the roof of the sensory niche and to have
entered the base of the stalk of the sensory club. In the enlarged end of
the club, the part which bears the sensory structure, the canal widens
into a terminal ampulla-like sac.</p>

<p>The endoderm lining the canal of the sensory club is specially differentiated.
In the stalk it is more columnar than the epithelium of the
stomach pockets, and is made up of cells containing a brightly staining
nucleus with very little trace of cytoplasm. The cell bodies appear as if
filled with a clear, non-staining fluid. Perhaps these cells give the stalk
elasticity to act in connection with the thin layer of longitudinal muscle-fibres
that are found just external to the supporting lamella. The epithelium
of the terminal enlargement of the canal is composed of very high
narrow cells, many of which show two nuclei of equal size and staining
quality lying side by side.</p>

<p>In continuation of the specialized epithelium of the perradial furrows
in the floor of the stomach the inner wall of the stomach pocket
shows a strip of similar densely crowded columnar cells leading from
the gastric ostium downwards to the canal of the sensory club. As in
the other case, the strip probably represents a specially ciliated tract, and
perhaps in it we see the reason why the canal of the sensory club is
almost always found to contain either spermatozoa which are shed by
the male reproductive organs directly into the stomach pocket, or else
floating cells of the kind to be described in the next section.</p>

<p>The canals of the interradial tentacles arise from the peripheral
gastro-vascular system much lower down than those of the sensory
clubs, since these tentacles have preserved their primary positions with
reference to the bell margin. <a href="#plate4">Figure 16</a> represents a section taken at the
level of the base of the pedalia which gives the connection of the tentacle
canals with the gastro-vascular system. At the level below the sensory
niche the four broad stomach pockets have been divided, as we have seen,
into the right marginal pockets (<i>mp</i>). The figure shows that in the
interradial corners the longitudinal septa (<i>ivl</i>, in the preceding figures),
or lines of fusion between the two walls of the peripheral gastro-vascular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
space, which divide the primitively simple space into the four stomach
pockets, have come to an end, leaving a connecting canal (<i>cc</i>) in each
corner as all that remains of the primitive uninterrupted communication
between all parts of the peripheral system. It is from these four
connecting canals that the tentacle canals take their origin. From this
point of origin each tentacle canal passes downwards, surrounded by the
gelatine of the pedalium, into the tentacle proper.</p>

<p>The connecting canals are of morphological importance in that they
are supposed, with much reason, to represent in the Cubomedusæ the
circular canal of the Hydromedusæ.</p>

<p>9. <i>Reproductive Organs.</i> The sexes are separate in Charybdea. In
both sexes the reproductive organs consist of four pairs of long leaf-like
bodies, each leaf attached along one edge to the wall of the subumbrella
in an interradius (see <a href="#plate1">Fig. 1</a>, <i>r</i>), and hanging free in the stomach pockets.
From this position in the stomach pockets it is evident that the reproductive
organs are endodermal. The lines of attachment of each pair is
just internal to the longitudinal vascular lamella that fuses the outer
and inner walls of the stomach pockets together in the interradius (<i>ivl</i>),
and the reproductive organs are therefore structures belonging to the
subumbrella. It is interesting to note how careful examination of the
medusan organization takes away from the importance of the outer cup,
the exumbrella, and adds to that of the inner, the subumbrella. We
have seen that the phacelli and the sensory clubs, from whose position it
would be supposed that they belonged to the exumbrella, are organs of
the subumbrella, and that there is no muscle-tissue in the exumbrella;
we find now that the reproductive organs belong to the subumbrella,
and it will be shown later that the tentacles, like the sensory clubs, are
structures of the subumbrella also. To the exumbrella are left only the
functions of support and covering.</p>

<p>The mature reproductive organs extend very nearly throughout the
entire vertical length of the bell, and are therefore found in the series of
cross-sections in all but the uppermost and lowermost (<a href="#plate3">Figs. 7-15</a> <i>r</i>).
The organs consist of germ cells within, covered by an epithelium of
columnar cells that shows here and there nettle cells. The ova are found
with different amounts of yolk, according to age, surrounding a large
nucleus almost devoid of chromatin and an intensely staining nucleolus.
In young ova there appears very plainly in every case at least one small
deeply staining body inside the nucleus, which very much resembles the
nucleolus. These are probably so-called yolk nuclei, and while I have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
made a special study of the ovogenesis, I infer that the constant presence
of at least one, points to an origin of the ovum from a syncytium (of at
any rate two cells), similar to that which has been recently shown by
Doflein (’96) to occur in the formation of eggs in Tubularia. In the
nearly mature ovary each ovum is surrounded by a layer of gelatine,
which comes from the gelatinous sheet that enters the leaf-like ovary for
its support along its line of attachment just internally to the interradial
septum. It seems as if the ova, arising in the epithelium on the surface,
pushed their way into the gelatine inside and there completed their
development entirely surrounded by a slight investment of gelatine,
which grows thinner around each ovum as it increases in size. In males
the testes always show a similar division into compartments by gelatinous
meshes, the compartments thus mapped out being filled with the
small brightly staining spermatocytes. Ova and spermatozoa when
mature are set free in the stomach pockets.</p>

<p>10. <i>Floating and Wandering Cells.</i> In the stomach pockets, the
canals of the sensory clubs, and even in the stomach itself, are found in
varying numbers freely floating cells having the appearance of young
ova. They vary in size, the smallest being of the size and having the
general aspect of the small ovocytes found in the ovary. The largest
(<a href="#plate4">Fig. 70</a>) have exactly the same structure as the young ovarian eggs
before they have begun to accumulate yolk. The granular deeply staining
cytoplasm, the clear non-staining nucleus with its bright nucleolus
and the nucleolus-like yolk nucleus, all show beyond doubt that these
freely floating cells originate in the ovary.</p>

<p>In some of my preparations these cells are found not only floating
free, but wandering through the tissues. <a href="#plate4">Fig. 70</a> shows two such wandering
cells fixed just as they were making their way either through the
digestive epithelium into the gelatine of the floor of the stomach, or from
the gelatine into the epithelium. The former seems the more probable,
though why they should want to get into the gelatine is not very easy to
conceive.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is some connection between this and the appearance
that the young ovarian eggs have of pushing their way from the epithelium
into the gelatine of the ovary. And of course it is not impossible
that the whole phenomenon is abnormal, due to rupture of the ovaries
which sets free young ova to exhibit their amœboid tendencies under
new conditions. Against such an explanation, on the other hand, might
be urged the fact that what seem to be the small floating cells are found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
occasionally in males as well as females, and that in the females a series
can be traced with a good degree of certainty between the small floating
cells like those found in the walls, and the larger ones which have all the
characteristics of young ova.</p>

<p>However that may be, this amœboid action of cells having the structure
of ova brings to mind the remarkable form of asexual reproduction
described by Metschnikoff for Cunina proboscidea, under the name of
“Sporogonie.” Unfortunately Metschnikoff’s original paper was not
accessible to me, so that I was unable to obtain more particulars on the
subject than those given in Korschelt and Heider’s text-book (p. 33).
The reproductive organs of both males and females of Cunina proboscidea
are said to produce, besides the usual distinctively sexual elements,
neutral amœboid germ cells, which wander into the endoderm of the
stomach and circular canal, and also penetrate into the gelatine of the
subumbrella. These amœboid cells divide parthenogenetically. One of
the two cells of the first cleavage continues to divide and eventually
forms an embryo of Cunina; the other remains amœboid and serves for
movement, attachment and nourishment of the embryo.</p>

<p>Charybdea, however, has shown no sign of any such reproductive
process on the part of its floating and wandering cells. The only indication
that I get as to their use points to a possible nutritive function.
The enlarged terminal portion of the canal of the sensory club almost
invariably contains a number of the small-sized floating cells. These
have a vacuolated, half disintegrated appearance, with the nucleus always
compact and brightly staining. Now, examination of the high columnar
cells that line the enlargement of the canal shows the presence in the
cells of bodies of exactly the same appearance as those in the lumen. In
one case a floating cell was found just at the end of an epithelial cell, to
all appearance half ingested. The identity of the bodies inside the cells
and those in the lumen is shown very clearly in some sections of material
fixed in formalin, which preserves nuclei, cell walls and general outlines
well enough, but does not retain the cytoplasm, and hence is useless for
most purposes of histology. In the endodermal cells of the terminal
enlargement thus preserved are found all the more distinctly the bright,
compact, degenerated nuclei of the ingested cells, while in the lumen are
seen other bright, compact nuclei with the poorly preserved remains of
cell substances around them. In addition to the evidence from the
appearance of the floating cells themselves and their ingestion by the
endodermal cells, a little collateral evidence may perhaps be brought in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
from the Tripedalia about to be described. From the ovaries in this
form are detached masses of cells (<a href="#plate4">Fig. 71</a>) which float free in the
stomach pockets among the developing embryos, and to judge from the
vacuolation that appears, are used up in their favor. These cell masses
are described more fully in the part on Tripedalia.</p>

<h3>B: <span class="smcap">Tripedalia Cystophora.</span></h3>

<h4>a. <i>Habitat.</i></h4>

<p>The species upon which the new family was founded was obtained in
great abundance in one locality in Kingston Harbor in the summer of
1896. The environment was even more unlike that in which Cubomedusæ
have been found heretofore than in the case of Charybdea Xaymacana.
On the west side of the Harbor there is a part more or less cut off
from the main body of water, and so from the ocean, by a peninsula.
This sheltered bay is dotted with small mangrove islands which toward
the head of the bay become so numerous as virtually to convert it into a
mangrove swamp. The water is shallow and discolored with organic
matter, showing that the tide does not exercise much influence here, and
the bottom is for the most part a black mud, deep enough to make
wading very uncomfortable but not impossible near shore. The islands
rise but slightly above the level of the waters, and the thick vegetation
that covers them, for the most part mangroves, grows out into the water
on all sides, forming a fringe of overhanging boughs. It was here in the
shelter of the boughs, among the roots and half-submerged stems of the
mangroves, that the small Cubomedusa was found to thrive. It could
be obtained in great abundance almost any day, and of all sizes from the
largest adults with stomach pockets filled with eggs or embryos down to
small specimens only about two millimeters in diameter. In but one
other place was Tripedalia found, and that was a similar region of half
landlocked water skirted with mangroves, situated near Port Royal,
across the harbor from the locality just mentioned. It would be hard to
find places in which the conditions of life were more strikingly different
from those of the pure deep sea in which the Cubomedusæ have been
generally found before. The slight brownish yellow pigment made the
small medusæ a little difficult to see in the discolored water, but like the
pellucid Charybdea in the clear water of the harbor, their active movements
gave away their presence. The swimming was very vigorous and
was effected by quick, strong pulsations (as many as 120 per minute were
counted), very different from the slow, rhythmic contractions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Discomedusan Cassiopea which was found in the same region over by
Port Royal. Whether or not the animal made intentional efforts to
escape capture could not be decided satisfactorily, but certain it was that
they did escape often enough by swimming quickly below the surface of
the semi-opaque water.</p>

<p>Tripedalia endured captivity much more hardily than the Charybdea,
and would live in aquaria happily enough for a number of days&mdash;no
attempt was made to see how long. Specimens with their stomach
pockets filled with ripe spermatozoa, or with young at any stage from
egg to planula, were taken in plenty from the latter part of June to the
latter part of July. In each female the young were all at the same
stage. The embryos were thrown out in the aquaria as free-swimming
planulæ, which settled down on the bottom and sides of the glass in a
day or two, and quickly developed into small hydras with mouth and
typically with four tentacles (and four tænioles, W. K. B.), though three
and five were by no means uncommon. In this condition they lived for
three weeks without essential change, and they were still giving no
promise of further development when the laboratory broke up and the
jars had to be emptied.</p>

<h4>b. <i>External Anatomy.</i></h4>

<p>The structure of the Cubomedusæ seems to be that of a type well
established, and accordingly offers no very wide range of diversity among
the different genera. The Charybdea that has just been described is a
very typical form and will serve well as a standard with which to compare
our species of Tripedalia. The resemblances are so close that a
detailed account of the anatomy of the second form would involve much
needless repetition. It is hardly necessary to do more than merely point
out in what points Tripedalia resembles Charybdea and in what points it
differs.</p>

<p>The form of the bell is less pyramidal than in Charybdea. Some
measurements even gave the breadth greater than the height. The
external surface is divided, as typical for the Cubomedusæ, into the four
perradial sides and the four convex interradial ridges, and the furrows
that separate these areas are with one small exception exactly the same
as those of Charybdea, as may be seen by comparing the series of
sections of Tripedalia (<a href="#plate5">Figs. 21-30</a>) with those of Charybdea (<a href="#plate3">Figs. 6-15</a>).
The exception is almost too slight to mention. The adradial furrow in
each octant which sets off the corner rib from the perradial surface in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the lower part of the bell is not directly continuous, as in Charybdea, with
the corresponding furrow in the upper part of the bell&mdash;that is, the <i>afr´</i>
of <a href="#plate5">Figs. 24-27</a> is not continuous with the <i>afr</i> of <a href="#plate5">Figs. 22 and 23</a>, as is seen
by both being shown in <a href="#plate5">Fig. 24</a>. The upper furrow (<i>afr</i>) is continued
only a short distance, however, below the starting point of the lower (<i>afr´</i>).</p>

<p>The pedalia conform entirely to the description given those of
Charybdea, except that there are three attached to the bell margin in
each interradius instead of one, and that the blade of each pedalium is
much narrower.</p>

<p>The sensory clubs also show exactly the same relation to the bell and
exactly the same structure.</p>

<p>In the bell cavity the proboscis has a longer and better defined stalk
than that of Charybdea, and has the further and more important difference
of possessing special sensory organs, to the number of fifteen or
twenty. The suspensoria are much more developed than in Charybdea,
so that the interradial funnels lying between are more marked. In a
corresponding way the frenula are larger and stouter (<a href="#plate6">Figs. 28, 29</a>, <i>frn</i>).
The musculature shows no new features and differs only in being comparatively
more strongly developed and having a more pronounced
striation. The nerve ring follows the same looped course from the
margin in each interradius up to the level of the sensory clubs in the
perradius.</p>

<h4>c. <i>Internal Anatomy.</i></h4>

<p>The stomach offers no peculiarities, and the phacelli also agree with
those of Charybdea except in having a smaller number of filaments in
each tuft. The stomach pockets are not guarded by such well-developed
valves as those described for Charybdea, though the valvular nature of
the lips of the gastric ostia is indicated and the valvular functions
undoubtedly performed. The gastric ostia are smaller (cf. Figs. <a href="#plate3">7</a> and
<a href="#plate5">22</a>), and this makes highly developed valves less necessary. No trace of
anything corresponding to mesogonial pockets was noticed.</p>

<p>In the matter of the marginal pockets, however, we find that the
agreement with Charybdea is no longer continued. The regions that
correspond to the eight marginal pockets of Charybdea are formed, as in
that genus, by the coming together of the exumbrella and subumbrella
at the sensory niche (<a href="#plate5">Figs. 25-28</a>), but each of these regions is subdivided,
as it is not in Charybdea, into two marginal pockets, a larger (<i>mp</i>, <a href="#plate6">Figs.
28-29</a>) and a smaller (<i>mp´</i>). In this way sixteen marginal pockets are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
formed as in the Chirodropidæ. Furthermore, as happens in the latter
family but does not in the Charybdeidæ, the marginal pockets extend
into the velarium. From each of the larger marginal pockets are given
off two velar canals, while each of the smaller gives rise to but one short
one (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 18</a>). <a href="#plate6">Fig. 30</a> represents one of the last sections of a Tripedalia
cut transversely, in which nothing but the pedalia and the velarium
appear, and in it are shown the velar canals (<i>vc</i>), which come from the
larger marginal pockets. The velarium appears in four segments because
it is drawn upwards in the four perradii by the frenula (see <a href="#plate2">Fig. 20</a>).
That the canals from the smaller pockets do not appear in the section is
due to their shortness and to the fact that they are pulled upwards above
the level of the sections by the frenula, together with that portion of the
velarium.</p>

<p>The smaller velar canals, a pair in each perradius, seem to have in
the males some function in connection with the storing of matured spermatozoa.
In specimens with ripe testes they are very often found
crowded to distension with spermatozoa, while the other velar canals
may or may not contain them, and generally do not. The epithelium
lining them is, like that of the others, composed of columnar cells higher
on the wall turned toward the bell cavity than on that turned towards
the exterior, but otherwise not specially differentiated. I searched in
vain for any trace of opening by which the spermatozoa might gain the
exterior. <a href="#plate6">Fig. 29</a> shows another point which may be mentioned in
passing, namely, that the canal of each of the three tentacles opens
into the peripheral gastro-vascular system independently. The central
tentacle of each group is the homologue of the single tentacle of Charybdea,
and is formed in Tripedalia before the two lateral tentacles appear.
Its communication with the peripheral pocket system is higher up than
the openings of the lateral tentacles, so that in the section drawn the
latter are just beginning to be indicated (<i>ct´</i>).</p>

<p>It remains only to speak of the reproductive organs of Tripedalia.
The sexes are separate in this form also, and ovaries and testes have the
same structure as is found in other Cubomedusæ. The development of
floating masses of cells in the females, however, is a feature which, so far
as I know, has not been observed before. These masses, of which a
small one is represented in section by <a href="#plate4">Fig. 71</a>, are apparently developed
along with the eggs, and repeat the structure of the ovary to all intents
the same as if they were various-sized fragments of it broken loose.
They consist mostly of high, columnar epithelial cells surrounding a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
central cells and showing here and there a nettle cell just as the reproductive
organ does. The epithelial cells differ from those of the ovary in
containing one or more large vacuoles, and this vacuolation increases as
the embryos, among which the masses float, develop. The idea naturally
suggests itself, therefore, that they serve for nourishing and perhaps for
protecting the embryos while they are developing in the stomach pockets
of the mother individual.</p>

<h2 id="Part_III"><span class="smcap">Part III: DESCRIPTION OF SPECIAL PARTS OF THE
ANATOMY.</span></h2>

<h3>A: <span class="smcap">The Vascular Lamellæ.</span></h3>

<p>In Medusæ it is a common thing to find that in certain definite
places of the gastro-vascular system two endodermal surfaces that were
primarily separated by a space have come together and fused into a
single lamella or plate. Such a structure is called indifferently a
cathammal plate, an endodermal lamella, or a vascular lamella. In the
adult animal the vascular lamellæ are by virtue of their very nature
formations “with a past.” They are scaffolding left in the completed
structure, giving us clues as to the way in which that structure was
brought about; and in the Cubomedusæ, whose development is as yet
unknown, they therefore afford an unusually interesting subject for
special consideration.</p>

<p>The vascular lamellæ that are found in Charybdea and Tripedalia
may for convenience be described as forming two systems, the internal
and the marginal. The former comprises the endodermal fusions that
separate the stomach from the stomach pockets (except for the spaces of
communication left free, the gastric ostia) and those that separate the
stomach pockets from one another. The marginal system consists of
the lamella that connects <em>endoderm</em> of the gastro-vascular system with
<em>ectoderm</em> of the surface in a ring all around the bell margin, and with it
also the vascular lamella of the sensory niche, which has already been
referred to in the general description of Charybdea. The lamellæ of the
internal system have been described by previous writers, and especially
by Claus in his paper on Charybdea, but they are still in need of comprehensive
and clear treatment. The lamellæ of the margin and of the
sensory niche have also been described by Claus, but not thoroughly or
with entire accuracy, nor did he recognize the vascular lamellæ of the
sensory niche as originally a part of the lamellæ of the margin. This last
was first determined by H. V. Wilson upon specimens of Chiropsalmus
quadrumanus obtained at Beaufort, North Carolina. Professor Wilson’s
unpublished notes on Chiropsalmus were very kindly placed in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
hands, and so far as the vascular lamellæ are concerned my own work is
only a confirmation and amplification of his, since Charybdea and
Tripedalia in this respect agree with Chiropsalmus.</p>

<p>The vascular lamellæ of the internal system are the most prominent
and morphologically the most important. They comprise the four
vertical strips of fusion that separate the four stomach pockets in the
interradii (<i>ivl</i> in the figures of the series of cross-sections of Charybdea
and Tripedalia, Nos. <a href="#plate3">6-15</a> and <a href="#plate5">21-29</a>), and four curved horizontal cross-pieces
at the top of these which separate the stomach from the stomach
pockets, and would make the separation complete did they not leave in
each perradius a free space between their ends, which makes possible the
gastric ostia.</p>

<p>The arrangement of this internal system of vascular lamellæ is
simple. What they amount to is a certain definite number of linear
adhesions between the two walls of an originally undivided gastro-vascular
space, by which that space is divided up into a central stomach
and a peripheral portion, and the peripheral portion thus further divided
into the four stomach pockets. Perhaps the idea may be conveyed by
likening the whole medusa to a couple of bowls fitting closely one within
another and plastered together at the margins. The exumbrella then
would correspond to the outer bowl, the subumbrella to the smaller inner
bowl, and the original undivided gastro-vascular space to the space
between the two. If now the walls of the space be cemented together in
four horizontal curved lines just in the plane where the bottoms are
bending round to become the sides of the bowls, leaving four interspaces
between the ends of the lines, we should have the original space divided
into a central horizontal somewhat lens-shaped region between the
bottoms of the two bowls that would correspond to the central stomach,
and a peripheral vertical portion between the sides of the bowls that
would correspond to the peripheral gastro-vascular system; central and
peripheral portions would communicate by the four interspaces between
the lines of fusion, which would correspond to the four gastric ostia. If,
further, the vertical peripheral portion be subdivided by four more lines
of fusion running vertically at equal distances apart, each connecting
above with the middle point of the corresponding horizontal line of
fusion, we should have the simple peripheral portion divided into four
parts, corresponding to the stomach pockets, by four vertical lines of
fusion, corresponding to the four interradial vascular lamellæ, the <i>ivl</i> of
the figures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>These mutual relations of stomach, stomach pockets and lamellæ
will perhaps be made clearer if a comparison is drawn between them
and the similar structures of a Hydromedusa. Liriope, one of the
Trachomedusæ, is a good form to take for such a comparison, since by
reason of its direct development from the egg it is free from the complications
of hydroid medusæ. The young medusa has at first a simple,
undivided gastro-vascular cavity which later is divided up into the
central stomach and the typical radial to circular canals of the Hydromedusæ
by means of fusions between the two endodermal surfaces. Diagrams
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> of <a href="#plate8">Fig. 35</a> represent very schematically this process of
division into stomach and canals. In <i>a</i> we have a projection upon a
plane surface of the primary, undivided gastro-vascular cavity, as seen
from above; <i>b</i> shows the first four points of fusion in the interradii;
<i>c</i> represents those four points expanded by growth in all directions into
broad cathammal plates in such a way as to leave the stomach in the
centre, the radial canals in the perradii, and the circular canal in the
periphery as all that remains open of the primary simple cavity. These
broad plates of vascular lamella, separating the narrow radial canals,
persist in the adult Liriope to tell the tale of the formation of the definitive
gastro-vascular system. It seems to me that we are justified by
analogy in drawing a similar conclusion for the Cubomedusæ. In <i>d</i> of
<a href="#plate8">Fig. 35</a> is represented a projection of a Cubomedusa, in which the
homology of the stomach pockets with the radial canals of the Hydromedusa,
and of the narrow strips of fusion with the broad cathammal
plates, is shown at a glance. To make the comparison more perfect we
have only to remember that in the Cubomedusæ there exists below each
interradial vascular lamella a connecting canal (Figs. <a href="#plate4">16</a>, <a href="#plate6">29</a> and <a href="#plate8">35</a> <i>d</i>, <i>cc</i>)
uniting the two separate adjacent pockets. This, as has been pointed
out by other writers, is the representative of the circular canal of the
Hydromedusæ. Practically the only difference between the structure of
the gastro-vascular system of the Cubomedusæ and that of a form such
as Liriope, is that in the latter the fused areas have broadened out at the
expense of the radial canals, while in the Cubomedusæ on the contrary
they have become long and narrow.</p>

<p>One is strongly tempted by the foregoing comparison to speculate a
little as to whether the reproductive organs of the Cubomedusæ, which
lie <em>in</em> the stomach pockets and are generally supposed to be endodermal,
may not bear some closer relation to those of the Trachomedusæ, which
lie “in the course of” the radial canals (Lang’s Text-book) and by common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
consent are ectodermal. And while we are being led by facts such as
those just mentioned above to wonder just a little whether after all the
position of the Cubomedusæ among the Acraspeda is so firmly assured&mdash;doubting
some, yet in the frame of mind of one who “fears a doubt as
wrong”&mdash;the velarium suggests itself as another point in question.
Haeckel does not hesitate to state emphatically that the velarium of the
Cubomedusæ and the velum of the Craspedote medusæ are only analogous,
but the reasons that he gives (sie sind unabhängig von einander
entstanden, und ihre Structur ist zwar ähnlich, aber keineswegs identisch;
namentlich das Verhalten zum Nervenring ist wesentlich verschieden:
System, p. 426) somehow do not produce so much impression
upon one as the very velum-like appearance of the velarium itself. The
origin from the fusion of marginal lobes is not as yet a matter of observation,
and the relation to the nerve ring is not essentially different from
that of the velum to the lower (<i>i. e.</i> inner) nerve ring in the Craspedotæ.
The four frenula and the diverticula from the gastro-vascular system
seem to be the chief differences in structure after all, and these Haeckel
evidently did not think worth mentioning. This speculation, as to the
possible relation of the Cubomedusæ to such forms of the veiled medusæ
as Liriope, though it may be very tempting, is scarcely fruitful enough
to repay much effort on the part of either reader or writer. The whole
subject must remain uncertain until the facts of the development of the
Cubomedusæ are known.</p>

<p>If the structure of the vascular lamellæ of the internal system has
been made clear, the appearances of the vertical and horizontal components
in the figures will be understood without much further explanation.
The four vertical strips in the interradii (<i>ivl</i>) have been already
referred to in the figures of the cross-sections of both Charybdea and
Tripedalia. In the longitudinal sections of the two jelly-fish through the
interradii, the vertical lamellæ are cut throughout their entire length
from stomach to connecting canals (Figs. <a href="#plate2">5-20</a>, <i>ivl</i>). The horizontal
cross-pieces at the tops of the vertical lamellæ also appear in several of
the figures. <a href="#plate4">Fig. 36</a> represents the appearance that would be given by a
longitudinal section taken through any portion of the upper part of the
bell except in the interradii, or in the perradii, through the gastric ostia.
The horizontal vascular lamella (<i>hvl</i>) is shown connecting the endoderm
of the stomach (<i>ens</i>) with that of the stomach pocket (<i>enp</i>). In a longitudinal
section directly through an interradius (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 5 or 20</a>) the horizontal
lamella is cut just at the point where it joins the vertical, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the two are not differentiated. In a section through the region of a perradius
(<a href="#plate2">Fig. 4 or 19</a>) the horizontal lamella is of course not cut, since the
section passes through the gastric ostium, whose existence is conditional
upon fusion not having taken place between the endodermal surfaces.</p>

<p>The first figure in each of the series of cross-sections (Figs. <a href="#plate3">6</a> and <a href="#plate5">21</a>)
also shows the horizontal vascular lamella, cut across slantingly twice in
each quadrant as it passes between the gelatine of the ex- and of the subumbrella
to connect the epithelium of the stomach with that of the
stomach pocket. The fact that more of the lamella does not appear in
such a cross-section only shows that its course is not perfectly horizontal.</p>

<p>The region in which the same lamella lies is indicated in the surface
view of the top of the bell of Charybdea (<a href="#plate1">Fig. 2</a>) by the bent line <i>hvl</i> in
each quadrant. The figure manifests the appropriateness of Claus’s
name for the horizontal lamella&mdash;“bogenförmige Verwachsungs-Streifen.”
Haeckel calls the same structures “Pylorus-Klappen,” and in
his account of Charybdea Murrayana in the Challenger Report, speaking
of the three divisions of the stomach (buccal, central and basal) which he
traces upwards from the stalked forms of Scyphomedusæ, he says: “The
central stomach in this Charybdea, as in most Charybdea, is joined to
the basal stomach, as the pyloric stricture between the two is not developed
and only faintly indicated by the slightly projecting pyloric valves.”
Again, in speaking of the valves of the gastric ostia, he says: “These
four perradial ‘pouch valves’ alternate with the interradial pyloric
valves.” It is difficult to understand, however, how the “bogenförmige
Verwachsungs-Streifen” of Claus, which are undoubtedly the same structures
as those which I have called the horizontal lamellæ, and are only
strips of endodermal fusion, can be “projecting pyloric valves,” or indeed
can properly be spoken of as valves at all. Possibly Haeckel was not
quite able to understand Claus’s description, and in his desire to find
something in the stomach of Charybdea which would serve to set off a
central from a basal part, such as is found in the Lucernaridæ, hit upon
Claus’s “Verwachsungs-Streifen.” I have elsewhere given it as my
opinion that in such of the Cubomedusæ as I have studied there is no
structure in evidence that would properly serve to mark a limit between
a basal and a central portion of the stomach.</p>

<p>We have next to describe the marginal system. The vascular
lamellæ mentioned above in every case connected endoderm of one
cavity with endoderm of another; those of the margin have the noteworthy
difference that they run from endoderms of some part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
gastro-vascular system to <em>ectoderm of the surface</em>. The outermost cells of
the endodermal lamellæ make direct connection with the ectodermal
cells, without the usual intervention of a layer of gelatine.</p>

<p>The marginal lamella of Charybdea lies, as the name implies, just on
the bell margin where the edge is curving round into the velarium. All
around the whole circumference of the bell it is found (in Charybdea) at
this same horizontal bend, except in the eight principal radii, where the
tentacles and the sensory clubs have brought about modifications. In
any place except these a vertical section through the margin will show
the marginal lamella connecting the endoderm of the marginal pocket
with the ectoderms of the surface, as represented by <i>vlm</i> in <a href="#plate4">Fig. 38</a>, which
is a vertical section through the sensory niche a little to one side of the
perradial axis.</p>

<p>In the interradii the marginal lamella undergoes modifications due
to the fact that the bases of the pedalia are situated a little upwards
from the exact margin, and that the lamella follows the outline of the
bases. <a href="#plate1">Fig. 1</a> shows one of the interradial corners of the bell margin
looked at directly from the surface, so that the curved outline of the
junction of the base of the pedalium with the exumbrella is seen. The
trace made by the lamella where it meets the surface ectoderm follows
this outline. The lamella is also shown in the vertical section through
the interradius (<a href="#plate2">Fig. 5 or 20</a>, <i>vlm</i>), where it is seen running from the
connecting canals (<i>cc</i>), which joins the two adjacent marginal pockets,
upwards and outwards to meet the surface ectoderm. Its course from
canal to surface is not in a direct line, but curved with the concavity
upwards. Hence, in cross-sections at certain levels through the interradial
corner it is met more than once and gives rise to appearances that
seem at first sight too complicated for it to be just the same structure as
the simple marginal lamella described above. That it is the same, and
that the complication is only due to the insertion of the pedalia above
the margin, can be determined by following through a series of cross-sections,
the essential ones of which, as I hope, are given in <a href="#plate6">Figs. 40-43</a>.
The levels of these are shown on <a href="#plate2">Fig. 5</a> by the letters <i>w</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> and <i>z</i>,
respectively. <a href="#plate6">Fig. 40</a> shows the lamella cut but once, just below its highest
part. The section is above the level of the connecting canal and hence
still shows the vertical interradial lamella <i>ivl</i>. <a href="#plate6">Fig. 41</a>, at the next lower
level (<i>x</i>), shows the same portion of the lamella intersected a little nearer
the interior, while the junction with the endoderm of the connecting
canal is shown still further inside. <a href="#plate6">Fig. 42</a> is at level <i>y</i>, just through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
bend of the loop, so that in part of its course the lamella is cut almost
horizontally, <i>i. e.</i> in its own plane. <a href="#plate6">Fig. 43</a> finally shows the lamella as
it appears below the level of the connecting canal, cut twice, each portion
joining endoderm of marginal pocket with ectoderm of surface. It thus
bears exactly the same relations that it had when we first met it in <a href="#plate4">Fig.
38</a> (<i>vlm</i>), except that here in <a href="#plate6">Fig. 43</a> one finds that a cross-section cuts it at
right angles instead of a vertical as in <a href="#plate4">Fig. 38</a>, as a result of its being
pushed upwards from its former position on the margin by the insertion
of the pedalium above the margin.</p>

<p>The vascular lamella of the sensory niche has already been alluded to
as part of the marginal system, and brief reference has been made to it
in the section on the sensory clubs. Like the rest of the marginal
lamella, it connects endoderm with ectoderm. The line that its fusion
with the ectoderm traces on the surface frames in a shield-shaped area
at the bottom of the sensory niche, which is seen in the drawing of the
outlines of the niche, <a href="#plate6">Fig. 44</a> (<i>vls</i>). This lamella was observed by Claus,
and was figured by him both in surface view and in cross-section
through the niche. Apparently, however, he omitted vertical sections
through the niche, so that he supposed that the outline traced by the
lamella was not continuous above, <i>i. e.</i> over the stalk of the sensory club
(’78, Fig. 41; text, p. 28). That the outline is closed above, though
masked in surface view by the roof of the sensory niche, is seen at once
in vertical sections, such as <a href="#plate4">Figs. 37 and 38</a>, one of which is directly
through the perradius, the other a little to one side. Both show the vascular
lamella of the sensory niche (<i>vls</i>) intersected twice, above and below
the sensory club, and completely cutting off the exumbrella from any
share in the bottom (or inner wall) of the sensory niche. <a href="#plate4">Fig. 39</a>, which
is a cross-section through the upper part of the niche, and is essentially
like the similar figure of Claus, shows in like manner that the bottom of
the sensory niche belongs to the subumbrella. H. V. Wilson was the
first to point out, in his unpublished notes, that the lamella of the niche
is complete all round.</p>

<p>In the adult structure of Charybdea and Tripedalia the lamella of
the niche is connected with that of the margin by a vertical strip of
endodermal fusion that does not come to the surface like the rest of the
marginal system, but remains just internal to the gelatine of the exumbrella,
connecting the two adjacent marginal pockets. In the cross-sections
of Charybdea it is seen in <a href="#plate4">Fig. 16</a> (<i>vlc</i>); in those of Tripedalia it
is seen in <a href="#plate6">Figs. 28 and 29</a>. In vertical section it is found in Figs. <a href="#plate2">4</a>, <a href="#plate2">19</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and <a href="#plate4">37</a>. In <a href="#plate6">Fig. 44</a>, which represents the bell margin and velarium of
Tripedalia arranged as if the velarium were vertical and pendant from
the margin (instead of suspended by the frenulum so as to be at right
angles to the vertical plane), the connecting lamella is shown as a dotted
line (<i>vlc</i>)&mdash;dotted because it does not come to the surface&mdash;joining the
lamella of the niche with that of the margin (<i>vlm</i>).</p>

<p>The same figure (<a href="#plate6">No. 44</a>) shows a characteristic difference between
the marginal lamella of Tripedalia and that of Charybdea. While in
Charybdea, as Claus points out, the marginal lamella keeps at one level,
just a little above the bell margin, all the way round (except where disturbed
by the special modifications of the tentacles and the sensory
clubs), and never descends into the velarium, in Tripedalia on the other
hand it describes a sinuous course, following the outlines of the marginal
pockets, as is indicated in the figure by the light parallel line <i>vlm</i>.
The course as it would be seen in a surface view is obscured just at each
side of the interradius by the overhanging of the bases of the two lateral
pedalia. This is why the lamella is not indicated at these points in the
diagram. The course is seen to lie almost wholly on the velarium, that
is, in the figure below the line which represents the bell margin proper,
the line at which the angle comes when the velarium is in its normal
position, horizontal to the vertical side of the bell.</p>

<p>In this sinuous course of the marginal lamella we have another point
of resemblance between Tripedalia and the Chirodropidæ. H. V. Wilson
worked it out in his sections of Chiropsalmus, and the reconstruction
which I have given in the figure under discussion is in all essentials
similar to his for Chiropsalmus. The differences lie only in the fact that
Chiropsalmus has more velar canals, and that the chief marginal pocket
in each quadrant is not forked peripherally, as is that of Tripedalia (<i>mp</i>),
but presents its distal margin parallel to the edge of the velarium. The
two smaller marginal pockets in the perradii (<i>mp´</i>) are on identically the
same plan in both.</p>

<p>Tripedalia, having three tentacles joining the umbrella in each interradius,
shows a disturbance of the course of the marginal lamella in
these regions by just so much the more complicated than in Charybdea.
The plan, however, is exactly the same. The lamella is pushed upwards
from the margin by each of the bases of the three pedalia just as is done
by the base of the single pedalium of Charybdea. <a href="#plate6">Fig. 29</a> shows the
lamella in the same relation to the canal of the central tentacle (<i>ct</i>) that
it has in the similar sections of Charybdea (Figs. <a href="#plate4">16</a> and <a href="#plate6">43</a>); and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
addition the first appearances (as the series is traced downwards) of the
arches of the lamella over the two lateral tentacles (<i>ct´</i>), which are
inserted a little lower down than the middle one of the group. As concerns
these lateral tentacles, the relations of the vascular lamella at this
level are the same as that in the level of <a href="#plate6">Fig. 40</a> for Charybdea.</p>

<p>It has been stated more than once already that the vascular lamella
of the sensory niche is a part of the lamella that runs round the margin,
and so far the only evidence given has been the strip of endodermal
fusion running from the marginal lamella to that of the niche. This
strip, however, as has been described, does not come to the surface and
consequently seems at first sight to be a different structure from the
lamella of the margin. That it is not, however, I found very prettily
shown in a series of sections of one of my youngest Tripedalia. In this
the lamella of the niche as it was traced in successive sections downwards,
was found not to form a closed ring at the bottom of the niche, but each
side was continued directly and separately downwards to the margin,
where it passed into the corresponding part of the marginal lamella. A
reconstruction of the condition, similar to that of <a href="#plate6">Fig. 44</a>, is given in <a href="#plate6">Fig.
45</a>, and I think explains itself at a glance. Evidently the vascular
lamellæ that connect the lamella of the sensory niche with that of the
margin at first come to the surface, like the rest of the marginal system,
but as the animal grows older come to lie within the gelatine. In this
way the condition found in cross-sections just through the margin of my
very small Tripedalia, and represented in <a href="#plate6">Fig. 46</a>, becomes that of the
adult seen in the corresponding portion of <a href="#plate6">Fig. 29</a>. It is as complete a
demonstration as could be required that the lamella of the sensory niche
is at first only a loop of the marginal lamella, a conclusion that had been
already reached by H. V. Wilson on theoretical considerations, based
upon the facts of the adult structure as he found them in Chiropsalmus.</p>

<p>As Wilson pointed out in his notes, these facts have a close bearing
upon the question of the origin of the velarium. Sixteen marginal
pockets are found in both Chiropsalmus and Tripedalia, and all of them
extend into the velarium. It is not unnatural to suppose that these
belong to sixteen marginal lobes, and that these lobes have fused together
to form the velarium. In the Chirodropus figured by Haeckel (Taf.
XXVI) in his “System” gelatinous lobe-like thickenings are shown in
the velarium, corresponding to the sixteen marginal pockets. In Tripedalia
no special gelatinous thickenings are found, but the arrangement
of the marginal pockets is the same as that of the Chirodropidæ, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
perhaps I ought, when treating of the systematic relations of Tripedalia
(<a href="#Page_5">p. 5</a>, Fam. III), to have recognized the analogy to the extent of saying
that marginal lobes may not be completely absent from the velarium of
Tripedalia. At any rate the gelatinous lobes in the case of Chirodropus on
the one hand, and on the other hand the sinuous outline of the margin
still mapped out by the lamella in Chirodropus, Chiropsalmus and Tripedalia,
are certainly very suggestive of an ancestral Cubomedusa in which
there was no velarium, but sixteen free marginal lobes instead. Two
more indications favor slightly the same view. In both Charybdea and
Tripedalia a small notch is seen in the edge of the velarium in the perradius
(<a href="#plate6">Fig. 44</a>). Its constancy suggests that it may not be a chance or
meaningless feature. The second point is the small size of the two
marginal pockets adjoining the perradius. These are in the position of
the ephyra lobes of the Discomedusæ, which always lie on either side of
each sensory club, and which do not keep pace with the other marginal
lobes in development. In the Rhizostome jelly-fish especially they are
found much smaller than the other lobes, as will be seen by a glance at
such figures as Haeckel’s for Lychnorhiza (System, Taf. XXXIV Fig. 2),
or for Archirhiza (Taf. XXXVI, Fig. 5), or Hesse’s figure of the margin
of Rhizostoma Cuvieri (’95, Taf. XXII, Fig. 22). The resemblance between
such margins and that of Tripedalia (<a href="#plate6">Fig. 44</a>), with its simple, unbranched
velar canals, is very suggestive. On the other hand it must be remembered
that in considering the vascular lamellæ of the internal system we
found the indication pointing rather more to Hydromedusan affinities
than to any other. Charybdea throws no light on the question, since it
has no marginal lobes on the velarium and the marginal pockets end
strictly at the margin, so that the only diverticula of the gastro-vascular
system in the velarium are the velar canals.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of marginal lobes and pockets I must
answer a possible objection that may occur to some careful reader. It
may seem that I am wrong in holding that there are two marginal
pockets in each octant instead of three, that just as there is one velar
canal from each of the smaller perradial pockets (<i>mp´</i>, <a href="#plate6">Fig. 44</a>), so each
prong of the forked larger pocket (<i>mp</i>), since it is continued into a velar
canal, ought to be called a marginal pocket likewise, the whole number
of marginal pockets then being twenty-four instead of sixteen. Such a
revision of the terminology would not be without some reason in its favor,
and perhaps a study of more forms would show it to be correct. But for
the present, at any rate, it seemed to me best to abide by the analogy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Chiropsalmus, in which the peripheral edge of the larger marginal pocket
in each octant is not bow-shaped, but runs parallel to the edge of the
velarium. A revision of the terminology of the marginal pockets such
as implied in the suggestion above would also give rise to complications
when applied to Charybdea, since the latter has no marginal pockets in
the velarium.</p>

<p>As to the functions of the vascular lamellæ, there is too little known
to say much. It is rather improbable that structures retained so definitely
should be mere scaffolding left over from a previous stage of
usefulness. Claus has found in Chrysaora that the lamellæ form a kind
of capillary network in communication with the gastro-vascular system,
and he with others supports the view that they perform an accessory
function in the nutrition of the tissues they penetrate. Upon this point
I have no observations of my own to add.</p>

<p>The marginal vascular lamella is regarded by Claus as perhaps the
vestige of a circular canal around the bell margin. On this subject, too,
I have nothing to add. A lamella of endoderm that connects directly
with the ectoderm of the surface along its whole course is a structure
whose meaning I am wholly unable to understand or even to guess at.
A similar lamella is described by Hesse (’95, p. 430) as occurring in the
ephyra lobes of his Rhizostoma, and he mentions Eimer as the first to
discover this structure, probably meaning the first to discover it in the
Discomedusæ. Whether the lamella is found all around the margin is
not stated. Hesse refers it to the ephyra, and remarks that the investigation
of it in the ephyra would undoubtedly give interesting results.</p>

<p>I will close this part upon the vascular lamellæ with a very pertinent
suggestion made by Professor Brooks to the effect that the usual way of
speaking of the sensory clubs as having moved up from the margin is
looking at the matter in the wrong way. The level of the sensory clubs
undoubtedly represents the original margin, which elsewhere has grown
down and away from its former level, leaving the sensory clubs like
floatage stranded at high-tide mark. Only in this way can the lamella
of the sensory niche have any meaning.</p>

<h3>B: <span class="smcap">The Nervous System.</span></h3>

<p>The nervous system of the Cubomedusæ is the most highly developed
that is found in any of the jelly-fishes. If the position of the group
among the Acraspeda is established, it alone is ample to prove that the
Hertwigs had not sufficient evidence when they stated in their monograph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
on the nervous system of the Medusæ (’78) that the Acraspeda
show a much lower nervous organization than the Craspedota.</p>

<p>The system naturally groups itself under three heads, the nerve
ring, the sensory clubs, and the motor plexus of fibres and ganglia that
underlies the epithelium of the subumbrella. The general relations of
the nerve ring and of the sensory clubs have been given before in the
description of Charybdea Xaymacana, so that we may pass at once to the
consideration of the finer details of the nervous tissues.</p>

<p>In the structure of the nerve ring I have found myself unable to
come to the same results as those given by Claus, who so far as I know
is the only one that has studied the nerve with special reference to its
histology. Our difference amounts to this, that he finds two distinct
types of cells in the epithelium of the nerve, sensory and supporting,
which would make it a receiving as well as transmitting organ, while I
have not been able to demonstrate satisfactorily the sensory cells, and,
therefore, so far as my own observation is concerned, I am disposed to
attribute to the nerve simply the function of conducting impulses. I do
not know just how much weight to assign to my inability to find
evidence in my sections of the sensory type of cells. Eimer (mentioned by
Hesse, ’95, p. 420), the Hertwigs (’78) and Claus (’78) have independently discovered
the two types in one medusa or another, and the Hertwigs, at least,
have demonstrated them by macerated preparations. So far as Charybdea
is concerned, however, Claus had only preserved material and had to rely
upon sections, as have I, since the material which I had preserved with
especial reference to maceration did not turn out well. The results that
we get from sections vary enough for me to believe that Claus interpreted
his sections very much by analogy with other forms&mdash;as indeed,
is suggested by his own words (’78, p. 22): “Da es mir nicht geglückt ist
die durch die längere Conservirung in Weingeist fest vereinigten
Elemente zu isoliren, habe ich das muthmassliche Verhältniss beider
Elemente nach Analogie der mir für die Acalephen bekannt gewordenen
Verhältnisse, welche O. und R. Hertwig so schön auch am Nervenring
der Carmarina zur Darstellung gebracht haben, zu ergänzen versucht.”
There can be no doubt of our having the same structures to deal with,
for C. Xaymacana is so much like C. marsupialis as to be perhaps more
worthy of being called a variety of the latter than a distinct species.</p>

<p>The structure of the nerve as I conceive it is given in <a href="#plate7">Figs. 47 and
48</a>. The former represents a cross-section, and shows, as others have
pointed out, that the layer of circular muscle fibres (<i>cm</i>) is interrupted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the nerve. It is evident that the tissues which elsewhere on the subumbrella
were differentiated into muscle epithelium and muscle fibre have
here become nerve epithelium and nerve fibre, a point that has not been
remarked upon before, so far as I remember, and that may be of interest
in connection with the neuro-muscular theory. The epithelium of the
nerve (<i>scn</i>) is seen to be made up of cells whose inner ends narrow down
into a kind of stalk or process that runs to the gelatine of the supporting
lamella (<i>gs</i>) and there joins a little cone of the gelatine that juts out to
meet it. The cells are smaller in general than those that overlie the
muscle layer, especially on the two lateral margins of the nerve, where
they are more crowded together and overarch the nerve-fibres. The
fibres are seen in cross-section between the processes of the cells. They
apparently must lie imbedded in some clear, watery fluid that does not
show in the preserved material. The processes of the epithelial cells
give the fibres the appearance of lying in alveoli, or being divided into
strands, and one of these strands (<i>ax</i>) is always discernible among the
others by reason of its more numerous or finer or more compactly
massed fibres. This is the “axis” of Claus. Here and there in its course
appear ganglion cells having their long axis in the longitudinal direction
of the nerve. Elsewhere, in the nerve as well, and usually nearer to the
surface, are found other ganglion cells, mostly bipolar, some multipolar,
which are readily distinguishable from those of the axis by the fact that
their long axis lies across the nerve. One of these cells is shown in the
figure (<i>gc</i>). Here and there in the epithelium alongside the nerve are
found mucous cells (<i>mc</i>), distinguished by their clear contents and by the
small exhausted-appearing nucleus at the base with a few threads of
protoplasm.</p>

<p>In <a href="#plate7">Fig. 48</a> I have tried to represent the structure of the nerve by
means of a series of five different views such as would be given by
focusing at five successive levels. In the first (1) we have the epithelium
of the nerve (<i>scn</i> in <a href="#plate7">Fig. 47</a>) in surface view, the cells appearing
polygonal in outline, with here and there a mucous cell. In (2) we find a
very slight layer of ganglion cells and fibres having a transverse direction
(<i>gc</i> and <i>fp</i> in <a href="#plate7">Fig. 47</a>). These are continuous with the plexus of fibres and
ganglion cells which lie above the muscle layer all over the subumbrella,
and which represent the motor part of the nervous system. This connection
with the nerve shows how co-ordination is effected. At the same
level are found fibres of the axis also having a longitudinal direction.
In (3) is seen the main body of fibres, divided in the osmic preparation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
from which the drawing was made into irregular wavy strands which
are in all probability largely the result of preservation, but are in part
also due to the separation by processes of the epithelial cells, as was seen
in <a href="#plate7">Fig. 47</a>. The axis is seen with one of its longitudinally directed bipolar
ganglion cells; and at the sides the fibres of the circular muscle of the
subumbrella. These show a slanting direction to the nerve, due to the
fact that the nerve, as mentioned before, has a sinuous course from the
margin in interradius to the level of sensory club in perradius. At the
next focus (4) we come to the gelatine of the subumbrella (<i>gs</i> in <a href="#plate7">Fig. 47</a>),
and below this (5) to the larger polygonal outlines of the endodermal
cells of the stomach pocket (<i>enp</i>, <a href="#plate7">Fig. 47</a>), which like the ectoderm show
mucous cells at irregular intervals.</p>

<p>A comparison, now, with Claus’s figures (’78, Taf. II, Figs. 19-21) will
show that, except for the rather unimportant matter of the mucous cells,
which he finds regularly and thickly disposed on each side of the nerve
(’78, Fig. 21), our only essential difference lies in the matter of sensory
cells in the epithelium. His figures show a multitude of spindle-shaped
sensory cells whose central ends are continued in processes that bend
around into the mass of fibres of the nerve. In his Fig. 20 a relatively
small number of nuclei, just one-third as many, are seen attached nearer
to the surface, which represent the supporting cells. The plan of structure
(as shown in his Fig. 20) is an alternation of (1) supporting cells
offering a broad peripheral end to the surface and having the central end
continued as a supporting fibre to the gelatinous lamella, and (2) spindle-shaped
sensory cells with nuclei at a lower level, which send their
peripheral process up between the supporting cells to the surface, while
the central process becomes continuous with the nerve fibres, often
branching into two processes. In my sections I have not been able to
see either a regular alternation of nuclei at different levels, or central
processes which unmistakably bend round into the nerve fibres. In
every case in which I could trace the central process of a cell clearly it
ran to the supporting lamella, and this whether the nucleus of the cell
lay near the surface of the nerve or deeper down, as in the somewhat
spindle-shaped cell seen on the left of the centre of the nerve in <a href="#plate7">Fig. 47</a>.
Of course in many cases the central process could not be traced in a
section, and this leaves room for the supposition that such were always
the sensory cells. From my inability to demonstrate sensory cells in the
nerves of Charybdea, I by no means wish to deny their existence; for
that remains to be proved, or disproved, by macerations. At any rate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
they cannot be so numerous as has been supposed. The position of the
nuclei shows that.</p>

<p>The epithelium of the nerve is said by Claus to be ciliated. It has
been suggested by Schewiakoff that probably in such cases the sensory
cells bear one long cilium, while the supporting cells have many smaller
cilia. Unfortunately, I made no observations upon the ciliation of the
nervous structures of the living animal, and the traces of cilia that are
shown in preparations of preserved material are a poor basis to speculate
much on. Claus considers the sensory cells of the epithelium of the
nerve a special seat of tactile sensation.</p>

<p>The way in which the nerve reaches the sensory clubs is interesting.
Under the topic of the vascular lamellæ it was explained that the sensory
clubs and the bottom of the sensory niche from which they spring are
parts of the subumbrella. <a href="#plate4">Fig. 37</a> reminds at a glance better than any
other one drawing how the bottom or inner wall of the niche is completely
cut off from the exumbrella by vascular lamellæ above and below
the stalk of the club. From this figure, now, it will readily be understood
that the nerve in order to pass to the base of the stalk has simply
to traverse the gelatine of the subumbrella. This fact, which seems surprising
enough at first sight in view of the position of the clubs on the
external surface of the umbrella, was correctly pointed out and explained
by Claus, but one or two figures will serve perhaps to give a clearer
idea of it.</p>

<p><a href="#plate7">Fig. 49</a> is a diagram of the nervous structures in the region of the
sensory niche, as they would be seen on the surface of the subumbrella
turned toward the bell cavity. The outline of the sensory niche as it is
seen through the tissue of the animal is represented by the line <i>osn</i>.
The sensory club (<i>scl</i>), and its stalk with a conical basal portion are given
by the lightly dotted outline and are also imagined as seen through the
animal. The nerve (<i>n</i>), being on the surface of the subumbrella, is shown
as a heavy line describing an arch over the outline of the niche. In the
middle point of the arch is a slight thickening of the nervous tissue (<i>rg</i>)
which shows in section a large increase in the number of ganglion cells,
and is the radial ganglion of Claus. The same is seen, exaggerated in
size, in <a href="#plate3">Fig. 12</a>. From it there extends upward a slender strand of
nervous tissue (<i>rn</i>), the radial nerve of Claus. In Charybdea this can
be traced but a very short distance. In Tripedalia it is much more
distinct and traceable for a longer distance, and I might say in passing
that this and the sensory organs in the proboscis are the only differences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
I have noted between the nervous systems of Tripedalia and
Charybdea.</p>

<p>Nerve ring, radial ganglion and radial nerve all lie on the bell cavity
surface of the subumbrella. The way, now, in which the nerve ring
reaches the base of the stalk is simply by sending two roots through the
gelatine of the subumbrella to the conical base of the stalk. These roots
are seen in the diagram at <i>rns</i>. After passing through the gelatine the
roots come together on the inner side of the base&mdash;that is, the side turned
toward the bell cavity&mdash;and then pass downwards (<i>nst</i>) on the inner side
of the stalk of the club to the mass of nervous tissue at its end.</p>

<p>This passage of nervous tissue through the gelatine in order to reach
the sensory club is a little hard to grasp at the first, and I have tried to
render it more intelligible by a couple of drawings of sections. <a href="#plate7">Fig. 50</a> is
a transverse section through the upper part of the region of the sensory
niche, not quite horizontal (<i>i. e.</i> parallel with the bell margin), but slanting
so as to lie on the plane of the reference arrow <i>x-y</i> in <a href="#plate7">Fig. 49</a>. The
plane passes just through the top of the niche, and in two areas has cut
through the roof with its epithelium of ectoderm (<i>ece</i>, <i>ecs</i>) so that the
space of the sensory niche (<i>sn</i>) appears. The vascular lamella of the
sensory niche (<i>vls</i>) is shown, as in Figs. <a href="#plate3">13</a> and <a href="#plate4">14</a>, running on each side
from the endoderm that lines the canal of the sensory club (<i>enc</i>) to the
endoderm of the adjacent stomach pocket (<i>enp</i>). By it the gelatine
of the exumbrella is separated from that of the subumbrella, and
one sees that it is only through the latter that the nerve has to pass in
order to reach the base of the sensory club. It is also seen that one part
of the roof of the niche which is cut through lies outside of the ring of
lamella and is therefore lined with ectoderm of the exumbrella (<i>ece</i>)
while the other lies within the ring and is lined with ectoderm of the
subumbrella (<i>ecs</i>). Owing to the slanting direction of the cut only the
root on one side is cut through. The other is indicated, however, on the
right side of the drawing. In this method of passage of nerve fibres,
together with the accompanying ganglion cells, directly through the gelatine
to the stalk of the sensory club my work is only confirmation and
explanation of Claus.</p>

<p><a href="#plate7">Fig. 51</a> is a vertical section through the base of the stalk in the
plane of the reference arrow <i>w-z</i> in <a href="#plate7">Fig. 49</a>, and therefore passing
through one of the roots of the nerve of the stalk. Here again the
region is seen to be cut off from the exumbrella by the vascular lamella of
the sensory niche (<i>vls</i>), and the nerve is seen passing through the gelatine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of the subumbrella from the surface of the bell cavity (<i>sc</i>) to the base of
the stalk hanging in the sensory niche (<i>sn</i>). One of the ganglion cells
(<i>gc</i>) that accompany the nerve is seen to have two nuclei, a not infrequent
occurrence which has been pointed out by others.</p>

<p>The same figure shows that the axis (<i>ax</i>) of the nerve has penetrated
the gelatine with the other fibres. Here at the base of the stalk it takes
a horizontal course and becomes directly continuous with the similar
structure of the other root, as Wilson, I believe, first pointed out. This
part of the nervous tract which runs horizontally along the base of the
stalk between the two roots (<a href="#plate7">Fig. 49</a>, <i>rns</i>) has been considered by Claus
the representative in Charybdea of the upper nerve ring of the Craspedota,
which therefore exists in Charybdea in four separate portions. Seeing,
however, that the region in which it is found belongs to the subumbrella,
the homology seems very doubtful. Moreover, the fact that the axis of
the nerve ring runs through this outer portion, instead of remaining on
the inner surface of the subumbrella and passing to the radial ganglion,
rather indicates that the outer portion is part of the original course of
the nerve ring, while the portion that remains on the inner surface is
perhaps a later formation.</p>

<p>A very interesting feature of the nervous system occurs in the same
region in the form of a tract of fibres underlying the endoderm, and
separated from the other fibres by the gelatine of the supporting lamella.
It is seen in vertical section in <a href="#plate7">Fig. 52</a> (<i>enf</i>), which is a section through
the base of the stalk in just about its median plane, and, therefore, to one
side of the arrow <i>w-z</i> in <a href="#plate7">Fig. 49</a> and the corresponding drawing, <a href="#plate7">Fig. 51</a>.
In cross-section it is represented also in <a href="#plate7">Fig. 50</a> (<i>enf</i>). It varies in size
and prominence very much in different specimens. <a href="#plate7">Fig. 52</a> is a camera
drawing of it in the case that showed it most developed. Ganglion cells
are found in it, but comparatively infrequently. In some cases the tract
itself can hardly be found with certainty. Hesse has described in a
Rhizostome a much more highly developed tract in a corresponding
position on the base of the marginal body. Fibres from the “outer
sensory pit” pass through the gelatine to the sub-endodermal tract,
which is described as surrounding the epithelium of the canal of the
marginal body like a collar and is most thickly developed on the under
surface of the canal, at the place that just corresponds with the point
where, and where only, I find the tract in Charybdea. Hesse thinks that
fibres then pass from this region to the nervous epithelium of the “inner
sensory pit” lying underneath the base of the marginal body, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
contains a rich supply of ganglion cells and is considered by him to be
the centre of the nervous system of the medusa. A close comparison
cannot be drawn with Charybdea in this matter, however, since Charybdea
has nothing to correspond with the “outer” and “inner” sensory pits.
Moreover, the endodermal tract is not found encircling the canal of the
sensory club, nor could I trace fibres passing from it through the
supporting lamella into the fibres of the nerves.</p>

<p>Claus has figured (’78, Taf. V, Fig. 45, <i>Fb</i>) a small bundle of fibres in
the stock of the sensory club lying between the endoderm cells of the
canal and the supporting lamella. The same bundle is found in both
Charybdea and Tripedalia and can be traced in cross-sections up the
stalk to a point which must correspond with that at which the endodermal
tract is seen in <a href="#plate7">Fig. 52</a>. Downwards it can be traced only as far as
the entrance of the stalk into the knob of the club where it invariably
becomes lost to view. According to Hesse (’95, p. 427) Schäfer found
under the endoderm cells of the whole stalk of the marginal body a
fibrous layer like that under the endoderm cells which he refers to
slender processes from the cells of the crystalline sac. Although Hesse,
as we have seen, finds the layer more limited in extent than Schäfer
gives it, and does not trace it to the same source, the observation of
Schäfer seems to me worthy of mention here, inasmuch as the trend of
the fibrous bundle under the endoderm cells of the stalk in Charybdea
and Tripedalia suggests quite strongly that the fibres come from the
crystalline sac, as Schäfer thought to be the case in his medusa.</p>

<p>Besides the radial ganglion situated in the course of the nerve ring
at its four perradial points there are four other similar ganglia on the
subumbrella. These lie in the interradii, at the four lowermost points of
the nerve’s course, and undoubtedly send off nerves into the pedalia at
whose bases they are situated. F. Müller (’59), whose work was not
accessible to me, is quoted by Claus as recording two ganglia opposite
the base of each pedalium which gave off a great number of nerves
partly into the velarium, partly into the tentacles. Claus observed
nothing of the kind in Charybdea and states that even the interradial
ganglia do not exist.</p>

<p>That they do, however, is shown without doubt in sections of both
C. Xaymacana and Tripedalia, but nerves to the velarium or to the tentacles
I was unable to find.</p>

<p>On the two sides of each frenulum and of each suspensorium are
found subepithelial ganglion cells in greater numbers than elsewhere on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the subumbrella, and I am inclined to ascribe to them also the importance
of special ganglia controlling the musculature of the frenula and
suspensoria. Certainly such ganglia would not be out of place.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that the greater prominence of the radial
nerve and the possession of special sensory organs in the proboscis were
the only points of difference I had noted between the nervous systems of
Charybdea and Tripedalia. These sensory organs remain to be described.
They are simple ciliated cysts containing a concretionary mass, and are
situated in the gelatine of the proboscis, irregularly disposed of at any
level, from the lips to the beginning of the stomach, and in any radius.
In one series of the adult animal fifteen were counted, of which seven
were situated about interradially, four perradially, two adradially and
two subradially. In another, twenty-one were counted, twelve in the
perradii and nine situated between the sub-and perradii. The one
shown in <a href="#plate5">Fig. 24</a> is in the perradial position, often seen. In the sections of
the very young Tripedalia in which the vascular lamella had not reached
the adult condition the sensory organs of the proboscis were not found,
although the sensory clubs showed practically no difference from the
adult. Their structure is very simple&mdash;merely a round or oval sac lined
with ciliated cells which bear up and keep in constant motion an irregular
coarsely granular concretion. <a href="#plate4">Fig. 53</a> is a sketch made in Jamaica
from the living specimen. Sections were somewhat disappointing in
that they added but little. <a href="#plate4">Fig. 55</a> was drawn to show that now and
then a mucous cell (<i>mc</i>) is found among the other cells of the sensory
epithelium. An irregular-shaped mass (<i>rc</i>) was always found inside the
cysts as the organic remains of the concretion. It gave no trace of
cellular structure and offered no evidence whether the concretion was
the product of one or few or of all the cells of the cyst. The latter would
be unique among the medusæ. Even if the otocyst is the result of the
activity of only one or a few cells, it is, so far as I know, the only case
known for the jelly-fish of a free, unsuspended concretion.</p>

<p>As to whether the cysts are of ectodermal or endodermal origin
could not be determined, but there was some evidence in favor of the
latter. <a href="#plate3">Fig. 56</a> is a drawing of one seen in optical section in a whole
mount of part of a proboscis, and shows a definite connection with the
endoderm of the proboscis. This was the only case when such connection
was satisfactorily established, but in sections it was not uncommon
to find what seemed to be the remains of the broken stalk, as in <a href="#plate4">Fig. 54</a>
(<i>rs?</i>). No connection could be traced between the cysts and any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
part of the nervous system. As to function, the idea that they serve to
give perception of space relations suggests itself as readily as any other
hypothesis.</p>

<p>We come now to the consideration of the terminal knob of the clubs,
the sensory portion proper. A complete and detailed account of the
complex structure of these organs would fill many pages and involve
much useless repetition. Claus (’78) has described them with accuracy,
but not in great detail, and since then Schewiakoff (’89) has given a
careful general description and has supplemented Claus’s work by
observations upon the finer structure made with the aid of more recent
technique. It seems in place for me, therefore, to give in the briefest
possible way a general idea of their structure, and to pass then at once to
the points in which my work has led me to different conclusions from
those of Claus and Schewiakoff. In brief, then, the knob of the sensory
club consists of a thick, complex mass of nerve fibres, more or less
imbedded in which lie the special sensory organs, surrounding the
ampulla-like terminal enlargement of the canal. The surface between
the special organs is covered with less specialized sensory epithelium.
The sensory organs are seven in number. Of these, four are simple
invaginations of the surface epithelium arranged in two pairs symmetrically
to the median line in the proximal end of the knob (the end where
the stalk enters) and having pigment developed in the cells so invaginated,
while the space of the invagination is filled with a gelatinous refracting
secretion. These are considered simple eyes. Two more of the organs
are complex eyes situated on the median line of the inner surface of the
knob, the upper one smaller than the lower, but having almost exactly
the same structure. Each has a cellular lens over which extends a superficial,
corneal layer of cells; below the lens a refractive “vitreous body”;
and below this a retina with pigmented cells. The seventh organ is the
crystalline sac, which lies almost at the end of the knob opposite to the
stalk and contains a large concretion. In view of the fact that the
sensory clubs <i lang="la">in toto</i> have been abundantly figured by Claus and
Schewiakoff, it is my intention to give but one simple figure of the
general relations, and I justify that one in that it was made from the fresh
material. <a href="#plate3">Fig. 57</a> is a camera sketch of the outlines given by a sensory
club seen in optical section from the side. The smaller upper and the
larger lower complex eyes which are situated on the mid-line, are seen in
profile, while the two small simple eyes give the outlines that they would
in a surface view of their side of the knob. Of course it is understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
that two similar ones would appear on the other side, since the four
simple eyes are symmetrically paired on either side of the mid-line. The
sketch seems to show at least this much, that even in the living state the
lens of the larger eye projects out beyond the other contours of the
surface, so that the marked convexity ascribed to it in descriptions is not
to be attributed to the preservation.</p>

<p>It is in reference to the structure of the retina and vitreous body of
the complex eyes that I have found myself unable to come to the same
conclusions as Claus and Schewiakoff. Since the work of the latter goes
much further into the detail of the subject than does Claus’s paper, it
will be sufficient for me to compare my results simply with those of
Schewiakoff.</p>

<p>The latter finds that the retina is composed of two kinds of cells,
corresponding to the supporting and sensory cells referred to in the
description of the nerve ring. These he figures (’89, Taf. II, Figs. 12 and
13) as alternating regularly. The two kinds of cells differ as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Shape. The supporting cells like those referred to before, are
cone-shaped, having a proximal fibrous process that runs into the underlying
stratum of nerve fibres, and on the surface of the retina a broad
distal pigmented termination. The sensory cells are spindle-shaped, the
proximal processes becoming continuous with fibres of the underlying
nervous mass, while the distal process runs up to the surface of the
retina (the part toward the lens) in between the ends of the supporting
cell. The two kinds of cells are accordingly designated as pigment and
visual.</p>

<p>(2) Position of nucleus. This comes in as a corollary of the shape.
The nuclei of the visual cells lie in the enlarged central part of the
spindle-shape, and, therefore, at a lower level than the nuclei of the
alternating pigment cells.</p>

<p>(3) Processes in the vitreous body. The distal processes of the spindle-shaped
visual cells are continued through the vitreous body to the cells
of the lens as rod-like visual fibres which lie in canals in the (supposedly)
homogeneous vitreous body. The pigment cells on the other hand have
no fibres passing from them through the vitreous body, but in the latter
are situated cone-shaped masses of pigment whose bases rest upon the
broad ends of the pigment cells without, however, being a part of the
cell.</p>

<p>(4) Pigment. The distal ends of the pigment cells in the retina are
strongly pigmented, as the name implies. The processes of the visual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
cells, which alternate with these, are pigmented likewise, but the pigment
is not so abundant and lies in the periphery of the cell body, leaving free
a highly refracting central axis.</p>

<p>If the relation of these cells to each other has been made sufficiently
clear, it will be understood that, in accordance with Schewiakoff’s scheme
of the structure, sections that cut the retinal cells transversely give very
different appearances at different levels. A section through the very
tops of the retinal cells, that is, the last section of the retina before
striking the vitreous body, would show large polygonal areas of heavy
pigment (the ends of the pigment cells), in between which would lie the
much smaller, less pigmented, highly refracting ends of the visual cells
(’89, Taf. II, Fig. 19). A section lower down in the retina, that is, more
toward the centre of the club, would strike the low-lying enlarged central
portion of the visual cells with their contained nuclei, and the smaller,
proximal ends of the pigment cells. It would, therefore, give the reverse
appearance from the preceding section, namely, that of large unpigmented
(or but slightly pigmented) areas (the swollen bodies and nuclei
of the spindle-shaped cells), and in between them smaller pigmented
areas, the ends of the proximally tapering pigment cells (’89, Taf. II, Fig.
20). A section on the other side of the one first described, that is, one of
the first through the vitreous body, would show pigment areas of the
same size as the large ends of the pigment cells (the cone-shaped streaks
of pigment in the vitreous body which according to Schewiakoff are
associated with the pigment cell), and in between them the cross-sections
of the rod-like processes from the visual cells, lying in canals in the clear
homogeneous ground-substance of the vitreous body (’89, Taf. II, Fig. 18).</p>

<p>Let me give a resumé of Schewiakoff’s conception of the structure
of the retina.</p>

<p>a. There is an alternation of pigment and visual cells, the nuclei of
the spindle-shaped visual cells lying at a lower level than those of the
cone-shaped pigment cells.</p>

<p>b. From the visual cells extend rod-like processes into the vitreous
body, lying in canals in the latter.</p>

<p>c. In the vitreous body a cone-shaped streak of pigment overlies
each pigment cell of the retina, which is not a part of that cell.</p>

<p>d. Apart from these pigment streaks and the rod-like processes of
the visual cells the vitreous body is structureless, probably a secretion of
the pigment cells.</p>

<p>My own work, now, has led me to a different conception, so that my
conclusions on the same points would be as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>a. There is not good evidence of an alternation of cone-shaped pigment
cells and spindle-shaped visual cells, with the nuclei of the latter at
a lower level than those of the former.</p>

<p>b. From some of the retinal cells otherwise not distinguished, there
extend rod-like processes into the vitreous body, such as described by
Schewiakoff.</p>

<p>c. The cone-shaped streaks of pigment in the vitreous body belong
to the underlying pigment cells, in fact are direct continuations of them,
and at their distal ends they are prolonged into fibrous processes lying
in canals of the vitreous body exactly like the visual fibres of Schewiakoff.</p>

<p>d. The vitreous body is not a homogeneous secretion, but is composed
of prisms of refracting substance, each with a denser central fibre.</p>

<p>Let us go over these four points in detail.</p>

<p>(a) As to the first, the question whether there is an alternation of
pigment and visual cells, I am not prepared as yet to make a positive
statement, since my not seeing both kinds as they are described has
little evidential value against the fact that Claus and Schewiakoff both
claim to have seen them. Perhaps proof could be obtained one way or
the other by maceration of fresh or of specially prepared material,
which none of us had. My evidence for not confirming alternation rests
wholly upon sections. <a href="#plate8">Fig. 58</a> represents a radial section through part
of the larger eye of Charybdea, made from an osmic preparation which
in this case showed two advantages over the material fixed in corrosive-acetic
(usually by all odds the best), namely, that the vitreous body (<i>vb</i>)
was not shrunken away from the retinal cells, as almost invariably
happens, and that the retinal cells were contracted apart from one
another in some places in such a way as to be almost equal to a macerated
preparation. Now, in the figure it is seen that there is an apparent
alternation of two kinds of cells, more regular than I usually find, but
the ones that are undoubtedly the pigment cells of Schewiakoff are the
ones that show the fibrous processes like his visual cells, and the pigment
streaks in the vitreous body are seen to be integral parts of the cells, not
cone-shaped masses lying in the vitreous body, merely associated with
the pigment cells. If these <em>are</em> the pigment cells of Schewiakoff, the
shorter cells in between must be his visual cells, yet they can by no
means be said to conform to a spindle-shaped type, nor are their nuclei
always at a lower level than (that is, internal to) those of the pigment
cells. If the long cells with the fibres are, on the other hand, considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the visual cells of Schewiakoff, then again we find nonconformity to a
spindle-shaped type, and nuclei not always at a lower level. The matter
of alternation of nuclei at different levels seems to me any way too slight
a distinction upon which to base a difference in function. It is a necessary
mechanical consequence of the crowding together of many cells on
one surface. And in many cases in perfectly radial sections through the
retina I find the nuclei fewer in number and arranged in very nearly a
single level. The retina of the smaller eye represented in <a href="#plate8">Fig. 69</a> shows
this. In sections further along in the same series the nuclei are found
at different levels, due without doubt to the slanting cut.</p>

<p><a href="#fig72">Fig. 72</a> is a horizontal section through the large eye, and shows that
here, too, when the sections pass through the eye just radially, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
nuclei are not found at different levels sufficiently definite to suggest two
kinds of cells.</p>

<p>In the inner corner of the retina in the same figure (<a href="#plate8">69</a>) are seen
cells without pigment which show nuclei undoubtedly at different levels.
These cells in this position are a regular feature in the retina of the
smaller eye. Schewiakoff considers them purely visual, because of the
lack of pigment. In so doing it seems to me he forgets his own standard
for discriminating between pigment and visual cells. The pigment cells
of the retina, according to him, are the same thing as the cone-shaped
supporting cells found elsewhere in the nervous epithelium, and are,
therefore, distinguished from the visual cells primarily by shape and by
position of nucleus, secondarily by the greater development of pigment.
When on the ground of pigmentation alone he calls the cells in the
corner of the retina visual, he judges them by only the second test, and
in so doing virtually admits, as it seems to me, that shape of cell and
position of nucleus are matters of no great moment. His own standards
place him in a dilemma. If on the other hand he judges by the lack of
pigment, the cells are visual; if by shape of cell and position of nucleus,
they are both visual and pigment cells without the pigment or supporting
cells. What use there would be for simple unpigmented cells in
one limited region of the retina is hard to see, so he naturally takes the
other horn of the dilemma and calls them visual because they have little
or no pigment.</p>

<p>The distinction, then, between pigment and visual cells is brought
down to one of pigmentation only. Schewiakoff’s test for this is that in
the visual cells “Das Pigment durchsetzt aber nicht das ganze Protoplasma
des centralen Zellenabschnittes, sondern ist auf seine Oberfläche
beschrankt (Fig. 19, <i>sz</i>), so dass der innere, axiale, stark lichtbrechende
Theil vollkommen frei von demselben ist.” (’89, p. 37.) That is, in a
section through the ends of the retinal cells each pigment cell will
appear as a uniformly pigmented area, while each visual cell will appear
as a light, strongly refracting spot with a ring of pigment around its
periphery. This is the arrangement given in his Fig. 19.</p>

<p>An arrangement so definite ought to be easily made out in sections,
yet I have not been able to find it so. My sections show considerable
difference in the amount of pigmentation even in material preserved
with the same killing agent. If the retina is heavily pigmented the
ends of the cells have the appearance shown in <a href="#plate8">Fig. 62</a>, which represents
a portion of a cross-section. The ends are seen as clearly defined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
polygonal areas differing among themselves in size, but not showing two
types of size, or two kinds of pigmentation, the one uniform, the other a
ring of pigment around a highly refracting central portion. If the
retina is but slightly pigmented&mdash;and some were so light as to make
depigmentation unnecessary&mdash;a difference is seen in the pigment, as
shown in <a href="#plate8">Fig. 63</a>, but in no case were areas found that showed a highly
refracting centre surrounded by a ring of pigment. (The unexplained
structures in <a href="#plate8">Fig. 63</a> will be referred to a little later.)</p>

<p><a href="#plate8">Figures 59-62</a> are a series of four successive sections drawn with the
camera lucida for comparison with Schewiakoff’s Figs. 20 and 19, and
to show that the presence of two types of cells plainly marked within the
retina by the position of the nuclei at different levels is at least not clearly
demonstrated. Only the nuclei are drawn, since the cell bodies are not
easily distinguished from the surrounding fibres. The eye is the same as
that from which <a href="#fig72">Fig. 72</a> was made. <a href="#plate8">Fig. 59</a> shows a relatively small
number of nuclei of slightly larger size than usual. These I take for two
reasons to be nuclei of the ganglion cells that are found in the fibres at
the base of the retinal cells (Figs. <a href="#plate8">58</a>, <i>gc</i>, <a href="#plate8">69</a> and <a href="#fig72">72</a>). They are the first
nuclei struck in tracing sections toward the retina, and in the series from
which <a href="#plate8">Fig. 58</a> was taken similar nuclei appeared in both transverse and
radial cuts through the retina stained brightly and clearly with hæmatoxylin,
whereas the nuclei of the retinal cells proper were stained a
diffuse brownish-yellow from pigment that had evidently gone into
solution. <a href="#plate8">Fig. 60</a> shows the closely aggregated, smaller nuclei of the
retinal cells surrounded by the nuclei of the outlying ganglion cells.
Schewiakoff’s corresponding drawing (’89, Fig. 20) shows at this level a
definite alternation of the bodies and nuclei of unpigmented visual cells,
with the smaller, pigmented, proximal processes of the pigment cells. In
the next section (<a href="#plate8">Fig. 61</a>) the pigmented ends of a few of the cells have
been struck, and the following section (<a href="#plate8">Fig. 62</a>) shows that, in this
heavily pigmented specimen at least, there is no good evidence within
the retina itself of two kinds of cells, so that it is apparent that at any
rate we cannot accept Schewiakoff’s conception of the structure.</p>

<p>(b) Yet the fibres that Schewiakoff observed and associated with
special visual cells occur beyond question. <a href="#plate8">Fig. 64</a> is a drawing of the
first cut through the vitreous body of Charybdea, and in among the
sections of the pigment streaks are seen sections of processes lying
within clear spaces exactly as Schewiakoff figures his visual fibres (’89,
Taf. II, Fig. 18). That the fibres occur is indisputable, but as to the cells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to which they belong I can say nothing except that from such evidence
as I have given in the preceding paragraph I conclude that they come
from pigmented retinal cells of not very different type within the retina
from the others, if different at all.</p>

<p>(c) On the third point, that the pigment streaks in the vitreous
body belong to underlying cells and are continued distally into fibrous
processes like the visual fibres of Schewiakoff, the evidence is decisive.
<a href="#plate8">Fig. 58</a> has already shown it, and if this were not enough, a case of
unusual stoutness of the fibres drawn in <a href="#plate8">Fig. 67</a> is conclusive. The
preparation from which the section is taken was one preserved with
corrosive-acetic, and I have drawn the outlines with the camera in order
to avoid exaggeration of the fibres as far as possible, and also to show
the shrinkage of the vitreous body (<i>vb</i>). It is the shrinkage of the
vitreous body that makes it so difficult to determine the exact relation of
structures seen in the vitreous body to the retina. The fibrous processes
run through the vitreous body to the “capsule” of the lens (<i>cp</i>) (see
also <a href="#fig72">Fig. 72</a>), a layer of homogeneous substance much resembling that of
the vitreous body, which is classed as a part of the vitreous body, but
usually in the shrinking adheres to the lens. The capsule is therefore
regarded by Schewiakoff as a secretion of the lens cells. Some fibres
were found by him to have the appearance of branching upon reaching
the surface of the capsule, others of passing through it and of seemingly
ending among the cells of the lens. The same appearances were given
in my sections. It is altogether impossible in the distal portion of the
vitreous body to distinguish between the fibres of Schewiakoff and those
that come from the long pigment cells. (<a href="#plate8">Figs. 64-66</a> represent the
appearance of the vitreous body at successive levels, and are from the
same series of sections as <a href="#plate8">Figs. 59-62</a> and <a href="#fig72">72</a>.) In Fig. 64 the sections of
the processes that Schewiakoff calls visual are easily distinguished from
the sections of the long pigment cells. In <a href="#plate8">Fig. 65</a>, which is two or three
sections nearer the lens, the pigment cells are shown by their cross-sections
to be tapering down, and in <a href="#plate8">Fig. 66</a>, nearer still to the lens, the
two kinds of processes are no longer to be distinguished from each other.
In a few cases I have found pigment in a fibre which but for this would
be called one of the visual fibres of Schewiakoff. Such considerations as
these, the similar appearance in cross-section, the finding of pigment in
a few cases, and the inability to trace to any readily distinguished special
type of retinal cell, make me wonder whether the visual fibres of
Schewiakoff are anything more than the distal processes of pigment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
cells, into which the pigment granules happened not to be produced at
the moment of fixation.</p>

<p><a href="#plate8">Fig. 63</a>, however, where the retina was only slightly pigmented,
rather speaks against this view, for the number of darkly pigmented
areas seen here (which are shown beyond question by radial sections to
belong to the long pigment cells) is not great enough to account for the
number of both pigment areas and visual fibres of Schewiakoff seen in
such a section as <a href="#plate8">Fig. 64</a>. This would throw the visual fibres of
Schewiakoff back upon some of the slightly pigmented cells of <a href="#plate8">Fig. 63</a>,
otherwise not distinguished. I think the question cannot be settled
without the maceration of fresh material, and experiments upon eyes
killed in the light and in the dark.</p>

<p>In such cases as that of <a href="#plate8">Fig. 63</a> it would seem conclusively shown
that the long pigment cells must belong to a different type from the
short, but as I have already said I can find no regularity in either their
shape or in the position of their nuclei. And on the other hand <a href="#plate8">Fig. 58</a>
shows that the reverse relation may obtain and the long cells be less
deeply pigmented on the edge of the retina than their shorter neighbors,
so that it looks as if all the short cells had to do was to project half their
pigment out into the vitreous body in order to become exactly like the
long ones. This they could do if, as is possibly the case, they are prolonged
into “visual fibres” of Schewiakoff that have escaped observation
and so do not appear in the drawing.</p>

<p><a href="#plate8">Fig. 58</a> shows one more thing that is worthy of remark in passing.
In the preparation in which the vitreous body (at this point at any rate)
was not shrunken away from the retina, the fibre from each long
pigment cell does not lie in a clearly defined space or “canal,” such as is
usually described as a constant structure of the vitreous body. Very
likely these canals are formed only by shrinkage around the fibres, and
the irregular shape of the spaces around the three fibres in <a href="#plate8">Fig. 67</a> rather
bears out the same supposition.</p>

<p>As to the structure of the vitreous body, apart from the fibres and
pigment streaks already mentioned, I find it to be made up of prisms
extending from retina to capsule of lens, each containing a central axis
or fibre. <a href="#plate8">Fig. 64</a> shows that the space around the pigment areas and
“visual fibres,” instead of being homogeneous, is wholly filled with the
polygonal cross-sections of these prisms. In Charybdea they are generally
more difficult to perceive than in my best material of Tripedalia
which was killed in acetic acid. In this the polygonal areas stood apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
from each other more plainly. Curiously enough I have been unable to
demonstrate in Tripedalia the “visual fibres” of Schewiakoff. Here and
there were found spaces that at first sight reminded of them (<a href="#plate8">Fig. 69</a>, <i>sh</i>),
but they contained no central fibre, and were probably due to shrinkage.
The polygonal areas themselves, however, often contained a clear
spot in the centre, at one side of which would be found the cross-section
of the fibre, as is shown in many cases in <a href="#plate8">Fig. 68</a>. The clear spot is here
undoubtedly due to shrinkage of the gelatinous substance of the prism.</p>

<p>I think that these prisms and fibres are the direct continuations of
retinal cells. In a section such as that drawn in <a href="#plate8">Fig. 63</a>, which takes
just the very tops of the cells of a slightly pigmented retina, in the
centre of the section just grazing the space that lies between the retina
and the shrunken vitreous body, most of the cells toward the middle
(where especially the extreme tips are taken) show in their centres a dot
exactly corresponding to the dots in the polygonal areas of the vitreous
body. In the exact middle of the section, where only the cell walls
appear, slightly indicated, a dot is seen in each case. The size and shape
of the ends of the cells correspond with those of the polygonal areas in
the vitreous body, and I do not doubt that the latter are continuations of
the former. The vitreous body, then, instead of being homogeneous, is
composed of the clear highly refracting outer ends of retinal cells. The
assumption lies near that these are the true visual rods, but of course it
is assumption only.</p>

<p>To give a brief review, the points in which my conclusions differ
from those of Schewiakoff are as follows: I find (1) that the long pigment
streaks are parts of retinal cells continued into processes like his
visual rods; (2) that the vitreous body is composed of prisms with central
fibres proceeding from retinal cells; (3) that I am unable to get satisfactory
evidence of two types of cell distinguishable within the retina, and
at any rate find considerable evidence against the two types he distinguishes.</p>

<p>These results are not wholly satisfactory, for they leave us with
three kinds of fibrous processes in the vitreous body which for the
present we are unable to trace to three, or even two distinguishable
types of cell in the retina. It would be more pleasing if we could
confirm Schewiakoff’s simple conception of the structure, with its one set
of visual rods in the vitreous body referable to a clearly marked type of
sensory cells in the retina, but I think the evidence that has been brought
up justifies the conclusion that in some respects he saw too much, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
other respects too little. This is not to be wondered at, since his material,
to judge from a single statement, consisted of but twelve marginal
bodies, and, moreover, the work on Charybdea forms but one portion
of a paper that is excellent for the clearness of its descriptions and illustrations.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject I must mention that Wilson suggested
from his observations on Chiropsalmus that the vitreous body had a
prismatic structure, but he was probably mistaken when he thought he
found evidence of nuclei in it. Claus says that the retina is composed of
pigment and rod cells alternating, and Wilson agrees with him, but
under a sketch of a sense cell from the nerve he makes the express statement
“not very well preserved.” It seems very probable, therefore, that
he followed Claus’s interpretation rather than independent observations,
and Claus interpreted his results very much by analogy of what had been
found in other forms.</p>

<p>The smaller complex eye which is represented in <a href="#plate8">Fig. 69</a> agrees in
structure very closely with the larger. The chief differences are that
sections do not show pigment extending into the vitreous body, that
there is no “capsule” to the lens, and that the lens seems to be supported
by a kind of stalk formed by a thickening of gelatine of the supporting
lamella (<i>sl</i>). The gelatinous thickening lies between the lens and an outgrowth
of endodermal cells (<i>en</i>) from the canal of the club. This
outgrowth is a constant feature, figured by Claus and Schewiakoff for
Charybdea, and by Wilson for Chiropsalmus, and found in Tripedalia
also. The regularity of its appearance in all three genera leads one to
suspect that it may have some significance not yet understood.</p>

<p>Just above the smaller eye there lies a mass of cells of peculiar
structure (<a href="#plate8">Fig. 69</a>, <i>nc</i>). They are of a rounded polygonal contour, with a
comparatively small circular nucleus in the centre, and are found in
this region only. In and amongst them bundles of fibrous tissue are
found in the sections, which pass from the surface cells to the supporting
lamella. Claus describes the contents of these cells as coarsely granular
protoplasm and says they cannot be taken for ganglion cells. He is
inclined to believe that they play the part of a special supporting tissue.
Schewiakoff, on the other hand, is convinced that they are ganglion cells,
and finds processes passing out from them (’89, Taf. II, Fig. 22). I find,
however, that the cell contours are perfectly regular and clearly without
processes, and it is incomprehensible to me how, if his material was at all
well preserved, he could for a moment have taken them for the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
thing as the big multipolar ganglion cells with large nucleus and
nucleolus which lie in about the same region and were correctly described
and figured by Claus but are not specially mentioned by Schewiakoff. I
cannot agree with Claus, however, that their contents are composed of
coarsely granular protoplasm. That which appears such by low magnification
shows itself under high powers to be a beautiful network with
thickenings at the nodes of the meshes, which is brought out very plainly
by a cytoplasmic stain such as Lyons blue. Around the nucleus is seen
a more or less well-defined clear zone. What the function of the cell is
remains as unknown to me as to Claus and Schewiakoff.</p>

<p>There is left one more point in reference to the nervous system upon
which I wish to say a word. Claus and Schewiakoff both describe the
wall of the crystalline sac as structureless, formed by the bare supporting
lamella. The credit is due to H. V. Wilson of finding in Chiropsalmus
that it has a special lining of epithelial cells, which he figures as a continuous,
flattened layer. In both Charybdea and Tripedalia I find traces
of the same in nuclei here and there, but whether they are the remains
of a once continuous layer or not the sections do not show satisfactorily.</p>

<p>This ends the account of what it seemed worth while to say at
present upon the nervous system. In concluding, the writer wishes to
express his thanks for the help afforded by Dr. Wilson’s notes, in particular
on the subject of the vascular lamellæ, and desires to make
especial acknowledgment of his indebtedness to Professor Brooks, whose
suggestions, based upon many years of experience with the Medusæ,
have been most welcome and helpful, and whose evidences of unfailing
kindliness, both in Jamaica at the time the material was obtained and in
Baltimore when it was being studied in the laboratory, take a most
honored part in the pleasant memories associated with the work.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
